## 🔍 Overview

**samplepath** is a Python library for **empirical analysis of flow processes** 
using the finite-window formulation of **Little’s Law**.  

It provides deterministic, pathwise measurement tools for analyzing long run
flow process dynamics: arrival/departure equilibrium, process time coherence, and
process stability along an observed sample path.

The package implements parts of a general computation framework for measuring
and modeling flow processes: [The Presence Calculus Project](https://docs.pcalc.org)

In this library we focus on tools to reason about **equilibrium**, **coherence**, and **stability**
of flow processes from observed event timelines.

### Background

For an overview of the key concepts behind this library and how they can be applied in practice, please see 
our posts continuing series on Little's Law and sample path analysis at 

[The Polaris Flow Dispatch](https://www.polaris-flow-dispatch.com)
- [The Many Faces of Little's Law](https://www.polaris-flow-dispatch.com/p/the-many-faces-of-littles-law).
- [Little's Law in a Complex Adaptive System](https://www.polaris-flow-dispatch.com/p/littles-law-in-a-complex-adaptive)

The analyses in these posts  were produced using this toolkit 
and can be found in the `examples` directory together with their original source data.

## Core capabilities

A flow process is simply a timeline of events from some underlying domain, where
events have *effects* that persist beyond the time of the event. These effects are encoded using
metadata (called marks) to describe those effects. 

The current version supports the analysis of binary flow processes. These are
flow processes where the marks denote whether the event represents 
the start or end of an observed presence of a domain element within some system boundary. 

These are simplest kind of flow processes we analyze in the presence calculus, but they cover the vast 
majority of operational use cases we currently model in software delivery, so we will start there.

### Requirements

The data requirements for this analysis are  minimal: a csv file that represents 
the observed timeline of a binary flow process: with element id, start and end date columns. 

- The start and end dates may be empty, but for a meaningful analysis, we require at least 
some of these dates to be non-empty. 
- The system boundary is optional (the name of csv file becomes the default name of the boundary)

Given this input, the toolkit provides

A. Core python modules that implement the computations for sample path analysis: 

- Time-averaged flow metrics governed by the finite version of Little's Law
   `N(t), L(T)`,`Λ(T)`, `w(T)`, `λ*(T)`, `W*(T)` (Please see here for definitions)
- Performing *equilibrium* and **coherence** calculations (e.g., verifying `L(T) ≈ λ*(T)·W*(T)`)
- Estimating empirical **limits** with uncertainty and **tail** checks to verify stability (alpha)

B. Command line tools provide utilities that that wrap these calculations

- Simple workflows that take csv files as input to run sample path analysis with a rich set of parameters and options.
- Generate publication-ready **charts and panel visualizations** as static png files. 
- The ability to save different parametrized analyses from a single csv file as named scenarios.

This toolkit provides the computational foundation for analyzing flow dynamics in 
software delivery, operations, and other knowledge-work systems.


## 🚀 Installation (End Users)

Pre-requisites Python 3 (3.11 or higher at present).

```bash
pip install samplepath
```

After installation, the CLI will be available:

```bash
samplepath --help
```

Or run the module directly:

```bash
python -m samplepath.cli --input events.csv --completed
```

To upgrade to the latest version:

```bash
pip install -U samplepath
```

## 🧠 Concepts

Deterministic, sample-path analogues of Little’s Law:

| Quantity | Meaning |
|-----------|----------|
| `L(T)` | Average work-in-process over window `T` |
| `Λ(T)` | Cumulative arrivals per unit time up to `T` |
| `w(T)` | Average residence time over window `T` |
| `λ*(T)` | Empirical arrival rate up to `T` |
| `W*(T)` | Empirical mean sojourn time of items completed by `T` |

These quantities enable rigorous study of **equilibrium** (rate balance), **coherence** (`L ≈ λ*·W*`), and **stability** (convergence of process and empirical measures to limits) even when processes operate far from steady state.

## 📂 Output Layout

For input `events.csv`, output is organized as:

```
<output or ./out>/
└── events/
    └── <scenario>/                 # e.g., latest
        ├── input/                  # input snapshots
        ├── core/                   # core metrics & tables
        ├── convergence/            # limit estimates & diagnostics
        ├── convergence/panels/     # multi-panel figures
        ├── stability/panels/       # stability/variance panels
        ├── advanced/               # optional deep-dive charts
        └── misc/                   # ancillary artifacts
```

Only the **known** subdirectories above are created.

## 🧩 Example Usage

```bash
# Analyze completed items and clean output directories
samplepath --input events.csv --scenario weekly --completed --clean

# Limit analysis to the past 60 days
samplepath --input events.csv --horizon-days 60

# Apply lambda percentile and warmup filtering
samplepath --input events.csv --lambda-pctl-lower 5 --lambda-pctl-upper 95 --lambda-warmup-hours 24
```

Results and charts are saved under the generated scenario directory.
