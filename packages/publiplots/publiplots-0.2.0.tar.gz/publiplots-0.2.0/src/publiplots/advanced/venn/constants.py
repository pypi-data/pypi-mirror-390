"""
Constants for Venn diagram layouts.

This module contains the coordinate data and parameters for rendering Venn diagrams
with 2 to 5 sets. The data defines the positions, dimensions, and angles for the
ellipses as well as the positions for the petal labels showing intersection sizes
and the set labels displayed outside each set's shape.
