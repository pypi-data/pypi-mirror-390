License:                       EUROPEAN UNION PUBLIC LICENCE v. 1.2
                              EUPL © the European Union 2007, 2016
        
        This European Union Public Licence (the ‘EUPL’) applies to the Work (as
        defined below) which is provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of
        the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence is prohibited (to the
        extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).
        
        The Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor (as
        defined below) has placed the following notice immediately following the
        copyright notice for the Work:
        
                Licensed under the EUPL
        
        or has expressed by any other means his willingness to license under the EUPL.
        
        1. Definitions
        
        In this Licence, the following terms have the following meaning:
        
        - ‘The Licence’: this Licence.
        
        - ‘The Original Work’: the work or software distributed or communicated by the
          Licensor under this Licence, available as Source Code and also as Executable
          Code as the case may be.
        
        - ‘Derivative Works’: the works or software that could be created by the
          Licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof. This
          Licence does not define the extent of modification or dependence on the
          Original Work required in order to classify a work as a Derivative Work;
          this extent is determined by copyright law applicable in the country
          mentioned in Article 15.
        
        - ‘The Work’: the Original Work or its Derivative Works.
        
        - ‘The Source Code’: the human-readable form of the Work which is the most
          convenient for people to study and modify.
        
        - ‘The Executable Code’: any code which has generally been compiled and which
          is meant to be interpreted by a computer as a program.
        
        - ‘The Licensor’: the natural or legal person that distributes or communicates
          the Work under the Licence.
        
        - ‘Contributor(s)’: any natural or legal person who modifies the Work under
          the Licence, or otherwise contributes to the creation of a Derivative Work.
        
        - ‘The Licensee’ or ‘You’: any natural or legal person who makes any usage of
          the Work under the terms of the Licence.
        
        - ‘Distribution’ or ‘Communication’: any act of selling, giving, lending,
          renting, distributing, communicating, transmitting, or otherwise making
          available, online or offline, copies of the Work or providing access to its
          essential functionalities at the disposal of any other natural or legal
          person.
        
        2. Scope of the rights granted by the Licence
        
        The Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
        sublicensable licence to do the following, for the duration of copyright
        vested in the Original Work:
        
        - use the Work in any circumstance and for all usage,
        - reproduce the Work,
        - modify the Work, and make Derivative Works based upon the Work,
        - communicate to the public, including the right to make available or display
          the Work or copies thereof to the public and perform publicly, as the case
          may be, the Work,
        - distribute the Work or copies thereof,
        - lend and rent the Work or copies thereof,
        - sublicense rights in the Work or copies thereof.
        
        Those rights can be exercised on any media, supports and formats, whether now
        known or later invented, as far as the applicable law permits so.
        
        In the countries where moral rights apply, the Licensor waives his right to
        exercise his moral right to the extent allowed by law in order to make
        effective the licence of the economic rights here above listed.
        
        The Licensor grants to the Licensee royalty-free, non-exclusive usage rights
        to any patents held by the Licensor, to the extent necessary to make use of
        the rights granted on the Work under this Licence.
        
        3. Communication of the Source Code
        
        The Licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as
        Executable Code. If the Work is provided as Executable Code, the Licensor
        provides in addition a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Work
        along with each copy of the Work that the Licensor distributes or indicates,
        in a notice following the copyright notice attached to the Work, a repository
        where the Source Code is easily and freely accessible for as long as the
        Licensor continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
        
        4. Limitations on copyright
        
        Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits
        from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners
        in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable
        limitations thereto.
        
        5. Obligations of the Licensee
        
        The grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and
        obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:
        
        Attribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or
        trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the
        disclaimer of warranties. The Licensee must include a copy of such notices and
        a copy of the Licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes or
        communicates. The Licensee must cause any Derivative Work to carry prominent
        notices stating that the Work has been modified and the date of modification.
        
        Copyleft clause: If the Licensee distributes or communicates copies of the
        Original Works or Derivative Works, this Distribution or Communication will be
        done under the terms of this Licence or of a later version of this Licence
        unless the Original Work is expressly distributed only under this version of
        the Licence — for example by communicating ‘EUPL v. 1.2 only’. The Licensee
        (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions
        on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the
        Licence.
        
        Compatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative
        Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed
        under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done
        under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause,
        ‘Compatible Licence’ refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to
        this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence
        conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the
        Compatible Licence shall prevail.
        
        Provision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the
        Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or
        indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available
        for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.
        
        Legal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required
        for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
        reproducing the content of the copyright notice.
        
        6. Chain of Authorship
        
        The original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted
        hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the
        power and authority to grant the Licence.
        
        Each Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she
        brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she
        has the power and authority to grant the Licence.
        
        Each time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent
        Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the
        terms of this Licence.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty
        
        The Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous
        Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or
        ‘bugs’ inherent to this type of development.
        
        For the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an ‘as is’
        basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including
        without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence
        of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property
        rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.
        
        This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a
        condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.
        
        8. Disclaimer of Liability
        
        Except in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural
        persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect,
        material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the
        use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial
        damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such
        damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability
        laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
        
        9. Additional agreements
        
        While distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional
        agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence.
        However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on
        your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other
        Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against
        such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional
        liability.
        
        10. Acceptance of the Licence
        
        The provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon ‘I
        agree’ placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence
        or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules
        of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable
        acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
        
        Similarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and
        conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this
        Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work
        or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.
        
        11. Information to the public
        
        In case of any Distribution or Communication of the Work by means of
        electronic communication by You (for example, by offering to download the Work
        from a remote location) the distribution channel or media (for example, a
        website) must at least provide to the public the information requested by the
        applicable law regarding the Licensor, the Licence and the way it may be
        accessible, concluded, stored and reproduced by the Licensee.
        
        12. Termination of the Licence
        
        The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon
        any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.
        
        Such a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has
        received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons
        remain in full compliance with the Licence.
        
        13. Miscellaneous
        
        Without prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete
        agreement between the Parties as to the Work.
        
        If any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
        law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a
        whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it
        valid and enforceable.
        
        The European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions
        of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required
        and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the
        Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version
        number.
        
        All linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission,
        have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of
        their choice.
        
        14. Jurisdiction
        
        Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,
        
        - any litigation resulting from the interpretation of this License, arising
          between the European Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, as a
          Licensor, and any Licensee, will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court
          of Justice of the European Union, as laid down in article 272 of the Treaty
          on the Functioning of the European Union,
        
        - any litigation arising between other parties and resulting from the
          interpretation of this License, will be subject to the exclusive
          jurisdiction of the competent court where the Licensor resides or conducts
          its primary business.
        
        15. Applicable Law
        
        Without prejudice to specific agreement between parties,
        
        - this Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union Member State
          where the Licensor has his seat, resides or has his registered office,
        
        - this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,
          residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.
        
        Appendix
        
        ‘Compatible Licences’ according to Article 5 EUPL are:

## Features

- [Static analysis without Suricata installation for any operating system](https://suricata-check.teuwen.net/readme.html)
- [Simple CLI with options to work with any ruleset](https://suricata-check.teuwen.net/cli_usage.html)
- [Documented, Typed, and Tested API](https://suricata-check.teuwen.net/api_usage.html)
- [CI/CD integration with GitHub and GitLab](https://suricata-check.teuwen.net/ci_cd.html)
- [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Koen1999.suricata-check)
- [Easily extendable with custom checkers](https://suricata-check.teuwen.net/checker.html)

## Installation from PyPI

To install `suricata-check` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/suricata-check/), simply run the following command:

```bash
pip install suricata-check[performance]
```

Installation should work out-of-the-box on any Operating System (OS) and is tested for each release using CI/CD on Windows, Linux (Ubuntu), and MacOS.

## Usage

After installing `suricata-check`, you can use it from the command line:

```bash
suricata-check
```

This command will look for a file ending with `.rules` in the currrent working directory, and write output to the current working directory.

More details regarding the command line interface can be found below:

```text
Usage: suricata_check.py [OPTIONS]

  The `suricata-check` command processes all rules inside a rules file and
  outputs a list of detected issues.

  Raises:   BadParameter: If provided arguments are invalid.

    RuntimeError: If no checkers could be automatically discovered.

Options:
  --ini TEXT          Path to suricata-check.ini file to read
                          configuration from.
  -r, --rules TEXT        Path to Suricata rules to provide check on.
  -s, --single-rule TEXT  A single Suricata rule to be checked
  -o, --out TEXT          Path to suricata-check output folder.
  --log-level TEXT        Verbosity level for logging. Can be one of ('DEBUG',
                          'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR')
  --gitlab                Flag to create CodeClimate output report for GitLab
                          CI/CD.
  --github                Flag to write workflow commands to stdout for GitHub
                          CI/CD.
  --evaluate-disabled     Flag to evaluate disabled rules.
  --issue-severity TEXT   Verbosity level for detected issues. Can be one of
                          ('DEBUG', 'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR')
  -a, --include-all       Flag to indicate all checker codes should be
                          enabled.
  -i, --include TEXT      List of all checker codes to enable.
  -e, --exclude TEXT      List of all checker codes to disable.
  -h, --help              Show this message and exit.
```

Usage of suricata-check as a module is currently not documented in detail, but the type hints and docstrings in the code should provide a decent start.

## Output

The output of `suricata-check` is collected in a folder and spread across several files. Additionally, the most important output is visible in the terminal.

`suricata-check.log` contains log messages describing the executing flow of `suricata-check` and can be useful during development, as well as to detect potential issues with parsing rules or rule files.

`suricata-check-fast.log` contains a condensed overview of all issues found by `suricata-check` in individual rules and is useful during rule engineering as feedback points to further improve rules under development.

`suricata-check-stats.log` contains a very condensed overview of all issues found by `suricata-check` across all rules and is useful when reviewing the quality of an entire ruleset.

`suricata-check.jsonl` is a jsonlines log file containing all the issues presented in `suricata-check-fast.log` together with parsed versions of *all* rules and is useful for programatically further processing output of `suricata-check`. An example use-case could be to selectively disable rules affected by certain issues to prevent low-quality rules inducing additional workload in Security Operations Centers.

## Issue codes

`suricata-check` employs various checkers, each emitting one or more *issue codes*.
The issue codes are grouped into several ranges, depending on the category of the checker.
Each issue group is explained in detail below.
For details regarding specific issues, we recommend you check the message of the issue as well as the test example rules under `tests/checkers`.

### Overview

| Issue identifier format | Description                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| M000                    | Rules pertaining to the detection of valid Suricata syntax. |
| S000                    | Rules derived from the Suricata Style Guide.                |
| P000,Q000                    | Rules based [Ruling the Unruly](https://doi.org/10.1145/3708821.3710823).                          |
| C000                    | Rules based on community issues, such as this GitHub.       |

### Mandatory issues

Rules starting with prefix *M* indicate issues pertaining to the validity of Suricata rules.
Rules with *M*-type issues will most probably not be used by Suricata due to invalid syntax or missing fields.

Not all invalid rules wlll be reported through *M*-type issues as some rules can simply not be parsed to the point where these issues are detected.
Instead, you can detect these rules through the `ERROR` messages in `suricata-check.log`.

### Suricata Style Guide issues

Rules starting with prefix *S* indicate issues pertaining to the adherence to the [Suricata Style Guide](https://github.com/sidallocation/suricata-style-guide).
Rules with *S*-type issues are likely to hint on interpretability or efficiency issues.

### Principle issues

An [additional checker](https://suricata-check-design-principles.teuwen.net) is available to check for design issues, which can be installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip install suricata-check-design-principles
```

Rules starting with prefix *P* indicate issues relating to rule design principles posed in the [Ruling the Unruly](https://doi.org/10.1145/3708821.3710823) paper.
Rules with *P*-type issues can relate to a specificity and coverage.

### Community issues

Rules starting with prefix *C* indicate issues posed by the community and are an extension on top of the other issue groups.
Rules with *C*-type issues can relate to a wide variety of issues.
You can propose your own community type issues that should be checked for in the [issues](https://github.com/Koen1999/suricata-check/issues) section.
