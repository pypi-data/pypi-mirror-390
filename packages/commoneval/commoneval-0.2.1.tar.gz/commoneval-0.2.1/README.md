# CommonEval

Code for staging LLM evaluation benchmarks in a variety of standard
formats for common evaluation.

The focus of this library is reading and writing benchmark data, but
it includes one example benchmark dataset in `data/eng` for
illustration purposes. Please do **not** use these files for
fine-tuning, since that compromises their ability to measure LLM
performance fairly.
