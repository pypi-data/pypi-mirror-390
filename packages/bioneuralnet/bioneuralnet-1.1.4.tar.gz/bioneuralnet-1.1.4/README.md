## 2. BioNeuralNet Core Features

BioNeuralNet is a flexible, modular Python framework developed to facilitate end-to-end network-based multi-omics analysis using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**. It addresses the complexities associated with multi-omics data, such as high dimensionality, sparsity, and intricate molecular interactions, by converting biological networks into meaningful, low-dimensional embeddings suitable for downstream tasks.

**BioNeuralNet Provides:**

- **[Graph construction](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html#graph-generation):**

  - **Similarity graphs:** k-NN (cosine/Euclidean), RBF, mutual information.

  - **Correlation graphs:** Pearson, Spearman; optional soft-thresholding.

  - **Phenotype-aware graphs:** SmCCNet integration (R) for sparse multiple canonical-correlation networks.

- **[Preprocessing Utilities](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils.html#graph-generation):**

  - **RData conversion to pandas DataFrame:** Converts an RData file to CSV and loads it into a pandas DataFrame.

  - **Top‑k variance‑based filtering:** Cleans data and selects the top‑k numeric features by variance.

  - **Random forest feature selection:** Fits a RandomForest and returns the top‑k features by importance.

  - **ANOVA F‑test feature selection:** Runs an ANOVA F‑test with FDR correction and selects significant features.

  - **Network pruning by edge‑weight threshold:** Removes edges below a weight threshold and drops isolated nodes.


- **[GNN Embeddings](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gnns.html):** Transform complex biological networks into versatile embeddings, capturing both structural relationships and molecular interactions.

- **[Downstream Tasks](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/downstream_tasks.html):**

  - **[Subject representation](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/downstream_tasks.html#enhanced-subject-representation):** Integrate phenotype or clinical variables to enhance the biological relevance of the embeddings.

  - **[Disease Prediction](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/downstream_tasks.html#enhanced-subject-representation):** Utilize network-derived embeddings for accurate and scalable predictive modeling of diseases and phenotypes.

- **Interoperability:** Outputs structured as **Pandas DataFrames**, ensuring compatibility with common Python tools and seamless integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines.

BioNeuralNet emphasizes usability, reproducibility, and adaptability, making advanced network-based multi-omics analyses accessible to researchers working in precision medicine and systems biology.

## 3. Why Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Omics?

Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and high dimensionality of multi-omics data, particularly their inability to effectively capture intricate molecular interactions and dependencies. BioNeuralNet overcomes these limitations by using **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, which naturally encode biological structures and relationships.

BioNeuralNet supports several state-of-the-art GNN architectures optimized for biological applications:

- **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN):** Aggregate biological signals from neighboring molecules, effectively modeling local interactions such as gene co-expression or regulatory relationships.

- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT):** Use attention mechanisms to dynamically prioritize important molecular interactions, highlighting the most biologically relevant connections.

- **GraphSAGE:** Facilitate inductive learning, enabling the model to generalize embeddings to previously unseen molecular data, thereby enhancing predictive power and scalability.

- **Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN):** Provide powerful and expressive graph embeddings, accurately distinguishing subtle differences in molecular interaction patterns.

For detailed explanations of BioNeuralNet's supported GNN architectures and their biological relevance, see [GNN Embeddings](https://bioneuralnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gnns.html)

## 4. Example: Network-Based Multi-Omics Analysis for Disease Prediction

- **Data Preparation:**
   - Load your multi-omics data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) along with phenotype and clinical covariates.

- **Network Construction:**
   - Here, we construct the multi-omics network using an external R package, **SmCCNet** [1](1)
   - BioNeuralNet provides convenient wrappers for external tools (like SmCCNet) through `bioneuralnet.external_tools`. Note: R must be installed for these wrappers.

- **Disease Prediction with DPMON:**
   - **DPMON** [2](2) integrates omics data and network structures to predict disease phenotypes.
   - It provides an end-to-end pipeline, complete with built-in hyperparameter tuning, and outputs predictions directly as pandas DataFrames for easy interoperability.

**Example Usage:**

```Python

import pandas as pd
from bioneuralnet.external_tools import SmCCNet
from bioneuralnet.downstream_task import DPMON
from bioneuralnet.datasets import DatasetLoader

# Load the dataset and access individual omics modalities
example = DatasetLoader("example1")
omics_genes = example.data["X1"]
omics_proteins = example.data["X2"]
phenotype = example.data["Y"]
clinical = example.data["clinical_data"]

# Network Construction with SmCCNet
smccnet = SmCCNet(
    phenotype_df=phenotype,
    omics_dfs=[omics_genes, omics_proteins],
    data_types=["Genes", "Proteins"],
    kfold=5,
    summarization="PCA",
)
global_network, clusters = smccnet.run()
print("Adjacency matrix generated." )

# Disease Prediction using DPMON
dpmon = DPMON(
    adjacency_matrix=global_network,
    omics_list=[omics_genes, omics_proteins],
    phenotype_data=phenotype,
    clinical_data=clinical,
    model="GCN",
    repeat_num=5,
    tune=True,
    gpu=True,
    cuda=0,
    output_dir="./output"
)

predictions, avg_accuracy = dpmon.run()
print("Disease phenotype predictions:\n", predictions)
```
