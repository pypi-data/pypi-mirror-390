    Fullreader class to handle the full OCR process for a given image.

    Attributes:
        readerEasyOcr (easyocr.Reader): EasyOCR reader instance for text recognition. 
            Used to read player and team names from cropped images of players.
            
        modelScore (onnxruntime.InferenceSession): ONNX Runtime session for recognizing scores.
            Used to recognize scores from cropped images of players.
        
        modelPosition: Currently NULL because easyocr worked just fine
        
        modelTablePath (str): Path to the custom YOLO model for table detection.
            Used to recognize the table area in the image, and the number of players in that table if there is one
        
        modelPlayersPath (str): Path to the custom YOLO model for player detection.
            Used to recognize player areas in the image, such as their positions, tags, names, and scores.
