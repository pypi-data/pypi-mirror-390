    """
    Closes small gaps in a Geometry object to form clean, connected paths.

    This function creates a new Geometry object with the modifications. The
    process is two-fold:
    1.  It iterates through each subpath (contour) and checks if the
        start and end points are within the given tolerance. If so, it
        snaps the end point to the start point, creating a perfectly
        closed shape.
    2.  It then checks for gaps between separate subpaths. If a `MoveTo`
        command starts very close to where the previous path ended, it
        replaces the `MoveTo` with a `LineTo`, effectively stitching the
        two paths together.

    Args:
        geometry: The input Geometry object.
        tolerance: The maximum distance between two points to be
                    considered "the same".

        A new, modified Geometry object.
