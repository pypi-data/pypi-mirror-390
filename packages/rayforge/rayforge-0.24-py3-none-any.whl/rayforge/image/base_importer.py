    An abstract base class that defines the interface for all importers.

    An Importer acts as a factory, taking raw file data and producing a
    self-contained `ImportPayload`. This payload contains the `ImportSource`
    (the link to the original file) and a list of `DocItem` objects
    (typically `WorkPiece` instances) ready to be added to a document.

    Architectural Contract:
    -----------------------
    To prevent "double transformation" bugs, all importers MUST follow a strict
    separation of concerns between an object's intrinsic shape and its
    physical transformation in the document.

    1.  **Generate Normalized Vectors**: The vector geometry created by the
        importer should represent the object's SHAPE, normalized to a standard
        unit size (e.g., fitting within a 1x1 box) while preserving the
        original aspect ratio.

    2.  **Assign to WorkPiece**: This normalized `Geometry` is assigned to
        `WorkPiece.vectors`. At this point, the `WorkPiece`'s transformation
        matrix should be the identity matrix (scale=1).

    3.  **Apply Physical Size via Matrix**: The importer then determines the
        object's intended physical size in millimeters and calls
        `WorkPiece.set_size()`. This method correctly applies the physical
        dimensions by modifying the `WorkPiece.matrix`, scaling the
        normalized vectors to their final size.

    This ensures that the scale is applied only once, through the matrix,
    and that `WorkPiece.vectors` remains a pure representation of shape.
