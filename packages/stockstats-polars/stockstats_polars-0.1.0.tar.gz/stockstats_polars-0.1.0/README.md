# StockStats-Polars

Namespace extension of Polars with stock statistics/indicator calculation helper

Polars implementation of the **stockstats** idea: compute technical indicators inline on your price (ohlcv) DataFrame with simple access.


# Inspiration

This project is inspired by [**stockstats**](https://github.com/jealous/stockstats).
A Pandas dataframe implementation of stock indicators.

A big thanks and credit to Cedric Zhuang for his work on that library. 
Whose implementations I've based this library upon.
