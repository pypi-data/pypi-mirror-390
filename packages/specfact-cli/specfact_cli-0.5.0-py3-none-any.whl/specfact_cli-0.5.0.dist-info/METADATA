# SpecFact CLI

## What is SpecFact CLI?

A command-line tool that helps you write better code by enforcing **contracts** - rules that catch bugs before they reach production.

Think of it as a **quality gate** for your development workflow that:

- ✅ Catches async bugs automatically
- ✅ Validates your code matches your specs
- ✅ Blocks bad code from merging
- ✅ Works offline, no cloud required

**Perfect for:** Teams who want to ship faster without breaking things.

---

## Quick Start

### Install in 10 seconds

```bash
# Zero-install (just run it)
uvx --from specfact-cli specfact --help

# Or install with pip
pip install specfact-cli
```

### Your first command (< 60 seconds)

```bash
# Starting a new project?
specfact plan init --interactive

# Have existing code?
specfact import from-code --repo . --name my-project

# Using GitHub Spec-Kit?
specfact import from-spec-kit --repo ./my-project --dry-run
```

That's it! 🎉

## See It In Action

We ran SpecFact CLI **on itself** to prove it works:

- ⚡ Analyzed 32 Python files → Discovered **32 features** and **81 stories** in **3 seconds**
- 🚫 Set enforcement to "balanced" → **Blocked 2 HIGH violations** (as configured)
- 📊 Compared manual vs auto-derived plans → Found **24 deviations** in **5 seconds**

**Total time**: < 10 seconds | **Total value**: Found real naming inconsistencies and undocumented features
