      # NOTE: Tests are intentionally NOT included in pre-commit hooks.
      # Reason: The Rust extension requires maturin build, but `uv run` reinstalls
      # packages on each invocation, which undoes the maturin-built extension.
      # This creates a chicken-and-egg problem that significantly slows down commits.
      #
      # Developer workflow:
      # 1. Pre-commit catches linting/formatting issues (< 5 seconds)
      # 2. Run tests manually: `uv run pytest tests/` (< 10 seconds)
      # 3. CI runs full test suite on push
      #
      # This keeps local commits fast while ensuring quality via CI.
