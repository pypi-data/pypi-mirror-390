# fullscreen-message

A command-line tool to show big messages across the entire screen which can be closed with any key press.

## Motivation
Finding notifications at the side of your screen can be a pain. It *is* useful when multitasking but sometimes you want somethign simple.

## Installation
You can install fullscreen-message using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

## Usage
Show hello world across the whole screen:
```
fullscreen-message 'Hello world'
```

## Alternatives and prior work
I found a PyPI package called [fullscreen-alert](https://pypi.org/project/fullscreen-alert/) which does somethign similar, but it didn't have my documentation and seemed to be a module rather than a command-line tool.

For the shell, you tools like [figlet](http://www.figlet.org/) to draw big messages.

## About me
I am **@readwithai**. I create tools for reading, research and agency sometimes using the markdown editor [Obsidian](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/what-exactly-is-obsidian).

I also create a [stream of tools](https://readwithai.substack.com/p/my-productivity-tools) that are related to carrying out my work.

I write about lots of things - including tools like this - on [X](https://x.com/readwithai).
My [blog](https://readwithai.substack.com/) is more about reading and research and agency.
