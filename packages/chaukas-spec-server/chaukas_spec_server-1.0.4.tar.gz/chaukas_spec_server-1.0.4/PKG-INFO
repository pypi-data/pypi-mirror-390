           copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
           (which shall not include contributions aggregated with other works).
        
           "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
           form, that is based upon (or derived from) the Work and for which the
           editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
           represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
           of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
           separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
           the Work and derivative works thereof.
        
           "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
           the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
           to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
           submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
           or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
           the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           copyright license to use, reproduce, modify, merge, publish,
           distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Work, and to
           permit persons to whom the Work is furnished to do so, subject to
           the following conditions:
        
           The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be
           included in all copies or substantial portions of the Work.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
           this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
           worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
           (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
           use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
           where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
           by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
           Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
           with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
           institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
           cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
           or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
           or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
           granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
           as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
           Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
           modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
           meet the following conditions:
        
           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
               stating that You changed the files; and
        
           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
               that You distribute, all copyright, trademark, patent,
               attribution and other notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
               the Derivative Works; and
        
           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" file as part of its
               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
               of the following places: within a NOTICE file distributed
               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
               as modifying the License.
        
           You may add Your own copyright notice to Your modifications and
           may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
           for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
           for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
           reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
           the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
           any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
           by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
           this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
           Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
           the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
           with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
           names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
           except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
           origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
           agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
           Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
           WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
           implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
           of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
           PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
           appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
           risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
           whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
           unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
           negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
           liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
           incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
           result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
           Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
           work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
           other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
           has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Conditions. When redistributing
           the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
           and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
           or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
           License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
           on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
           of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
           defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
           incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
           of your accepting any such warranty or additional conditions.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
        APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
           To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
           boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

Server-side Python framework for implementing the Chaukas agent audit and explainability platform.

## Installation

```bash
pip install chaukas-spec-server
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Server Implementation

```python
import grpc
from concurrent import futures
from chaukas.spec.server.v1.server_pb2_grpc import (
    ChaukasServerServiceServicer, 
    add_ChaukasServerServiceServicer_to_server
)

            supports_batch_ingestion=True,
            supports_event_querying=True,
            supports_statistics=True,
            max_batch_size=1000
        )
        return GetCapabilitiesResponse(capabilities=capabilities)
    
    def IngestEvent(self, request, context):
        """Handle single event ingestion"""
        event = request.event
        
        # Process the event (your implementation here)

        for event in events:
            try:
                # Process each event (your implementation here)
                print(f"Processing event: {event.event_id}")
                accepted_count += 1
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Failed to process {event.event_id}: {e}")
                rejected_event_ids.append(event.event_id)
        
        return IngestEventBatchResponse(
            batch_id=f"batch_{int(time.time())}",
            accepted_count=accepted_count,
            rejected_count=len(rejected_event_ids),

                str(EventType.EVENT_TYPE_AGENT_START): 200,
            },
            avg_session_duration_ms=30000.0
        )

### Working with New Event Types

```python
from chaukas.spec.common.v1.events_pb2 import (
    Event, EventType, AgentHandoff, MCPCall, ToolCall
)
from google.protobuf.struct_pb2 import Struct

def handle_agent_handoff_event(self, event):
    """Process agent handoff events"""
    if event.HasField('agent_handoff'):
        handoff = event.agent_handoff
        print(f"Agent handoff: {handoff.from_agent_name} -> {handoff.to_agent_name}")
        print(f"Reason: {handoff.reason}")
        print(f"Type: {handoff.handoff_type}")

def handle_mcp_call_event(self, event):
    """Process MCP call events"""
    if event.HasField('mcp_call'):
        mcp = event.mcp_call
        print(f"MCP Call: {mcp.server_name} - {mcp.operation}")
        print(f"Execution time: {mcp.execution_time_ms}ms")

def create_enhanced_tool_event(self):
    """Create tool event with enhanced function tracking"""
    tool_call = ToolCall(
        id="call_123",
        name="calculator",
        function_name="multiply",  # New: granular function tracking
        auth_required=False
    )
    
    return Event(
        event_id="evt_tool_456",
        type=EventType.EVENT_TYPE_TOOL_CALL_START,
        trace_id="trace_abc123",  # New: distributed tracing
        tool_call=tool_call
    )

# Run the server
def serve():
    server = grpc.server(futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10))
    add_ChaukasServerServiceServicer_to_server(MyChaukasServer(), server)
    
    listen_addr = '[::]:50051'
    server.add_insecure_port(listen_addr)
    
    print(f"Starting Chaukas server on {listen_addr}")
    server.start()
    server.wait_for_termination()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    import time
    serve()
```

### Event Processing Patterns

#### Stream Processing

```python
def IngestEventBatch(self, request, context):
    """Process events in streaming fashion"""
    for event in request.event_batch.events:
        # Validate event
        if not self.validate_event(event):
            continue
            
        # Transform event
        processed_event = self.transform_event(event)
        
        # Store event
        self.store_event(processed_event)
        
        # Trigger real-time processing
        self.process_event_async(processed_event)
    
    return IngestEventBatchResponse(
        accepted_count=len(request.event_batch.events),
        rejected_count=0
    )
```

#### Event Validation

```python
from chaukas.spec.common.v1.events_pb2 import EventStatus, Severity

def validate_event(self, event):
    """Validate incoming event"""
    if not event.event_id:
        return False
    
    if not event.tenant_id:
        return False
        
    if event.type == EventType.EVENT_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED:
        return False
        
    return True

def enrich_event(self, event):
    """Add server-side metadata"""
    import time
    from google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2 import Timestamp
    
    # Add server timestamp
    now = Timestamp()
    now.GetCurrentTime()
    event.server_timestamp.CopyFrom(now)
    
    # Set processing status
    event.status = EventStatus.EVENT_STATUS_IN_PROGRESS
    
    return event
```

#### Database Integration Example

```python
import asyncio
import aiopg

class AsyncChaukasServer(ChaukasServerServiceServicer):
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_pool = None
    
    async def init_db(self):
        """Initialize database connection pool"""
        self.db_pool = await aiopg.create_pool(
            "postgresql://user:pass@localhost/chaukas"
        )
    
    def IngestEvent(self, request, context):
        """Handle single event with async processing"""
        event = request.event
        
        # Run async processing in background
        asyncio.create_task(self.store_event_async(event))
        
        return IngestEventResponse(
            event_id=event.event_id,
            status="accepted"
        )
    
    async def store_event_async(self, event):

## Error Handling

```python
import grpc

def IngestEvent(self, request, context):
    try:
        # Process event
        result = self.process_event(request.event)
        return IngestEventResponse(event_id=request.event.event_id, status="accepted")
        
    except ValidationError as e:
        context.set_code(grpc.StatusCode.INVALID_ARGUMENT)
        context.set_details(str(e))
        return IngestEventResponse()
        
    except StorageError as e:
        context.set_code(grpc.StatusCode.INTERNAL)
        context.set_details("Failed to store event")
        return IngestEventResponse()
        
    except Exception as e:
        context.set_code(grpc.StatusCode.UNKNOWN)
        context.set_details("Unexpected error occurred")
        return IngestEventResponse()
```
