# VoiceControlX-Raj

**A local, offline voice assistant for Windows. Control your PC using Python and voice commands.**

---

## Overview

`VoiceControlX-Raj` helps **developers, office users, hobbyists, and accessibility users** automate common tasks on Windows using natural voice commands.  

With just your microphone and a few commands, you can:
- Open **applications** like Chrome, Notepad, Spotify, Calculator, YouTube  
- Take **screenshots**  
- Check **current system time**  
- **Lock your PC**  
- Create **custom commands** via a JSON configuration  
- Run **offline** or online voice recognition

---

## Why This Project?

I built this library to demonstrate a **real-world voice automation scenario** â€” controlling Windows PCs hands-free using Python.  

This project demonstrates:
- Python **packaging and CLI development**  
- **Speech recognition** and **text-to-speech** (online & offline)  
- Windows **system automation** using Python  
- Open-source best practices (README, tests, PyPI readiness)  

Great to showcase on a **fresher Python developer or data engineer resume**!
