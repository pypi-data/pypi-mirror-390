# GPTQuery – Modular Tool Framework

GPTQuery is a modular Python framework for building, orchestrating, and deploying AI-powered tools across domains. It provides a clear, scalable architecture for integrating multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Perplexity, Claude, etc.) while maintaining robust error handling, throttling, and dynamic prompting.

The goal of this project is for researchers (or anyone) to create tools derived from custom prompts that can be easily integrated into reserach pipelines.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified interface for OpenAI, Perplexity, Claude, and other AI APIs.  
- **Modular Tool Design**: Organize AI functionality into independent, reusable tool families.  
- **Task Step Separation**: Each tool can have multiple steps or functional modules.  
- **Smart Defaults**: Automatically selects optimal models or parameters per provider.  
- **Safe Data Operations**: Uses `@requires_columns` for safe DataFrame operations.
- **Advanced Throttling**: Token bucket and adaptive rate-limiters for API management.  
- **Robust Error Handling**: Preserves partial results and gracefully handles failures.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Integrates token management to reduce API costs.  

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

GPTQuery is organized into **three main layers**:

1. **Core Infrastructure (`core/`)**  
   - Clients, logging, and utilities.

2. **Processing Utilities (`processing/`)**  
   - Helpers for throttling, token management, and miscellaneous runtime functions.

3. **Task-Specific Tools (`tools/`)**  
   - Each tool lives in its own namespace (e.g., `tool_name`).  
   - Tools are subdivided into **submodules/steps**:
     - `task.py` → user-facing functions (`run_*`)  
     - `prompt.py` → AI prompt definitions  
     - `log.py` → logging utilities  
   - The tool’s `__init__.py` exposes the main public API.

**Example: A generic AI tool (`tool_example`)**

```shell
tool_example/
├── step_one/
│ ├── task.py # run_step_one
│ ├── prompt.py
│ └── log.py
├── step_two/
│ ├── task.py # run_step_two
│ ├── prompt.py
│ └── log.py
└── init.py # exposes run_step_one, run_step_two
```

## 🛠️ Installation

Option 1: Install from PyPI (recommended)
Install the latest stable release directly from PyPI using pip:

```shell
pip install gptquerytools
```

Option 2: Clone the repository (for development and custom tools)
If you want to contribute or build custom tools based on GPTQuery, clone the repo and install dependencies:

```shell
# 1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/mauriciomm7/gptquery.git
cd gptquery
# 2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🤝 Contrubuting

To integrate your tool into GPTQuery, please:

- Place your tool inside the tools/ directory following the existing modular structure.

- Organize your tool with submodules for each step or feature, including:
  - `task.py` for core functionality,
  - `prompt.py` for AI prompts,
  - `log.py` for logging.

- Expose your tool’s API in its `__init__.py`.
- Write tests and update documentation as needed.
- Submit a pull request with clear explanations of your additions.

Thank you for contributing to GPTQuery!
