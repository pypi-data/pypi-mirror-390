 *
 * The direction of the flux at the cell edges is determined by the sign

 * of the one-dimensional coefficients.
 *
 * The default upwind flux will yield highest convergence rate, but it will take
 * into account only the coefficient from this dimension, i.e., assuming
 * the other dimensions have positive coefficients.
 * If a term in another dimension has a negative sign, then the upwind has
 * to manually swapped with a downwind flux.
 * If the coefficient is unknown or indeterminate, e.g., depends on the moments,
 * or the coefficient in another dimension can change sign,
 * then the central flux should be used.
 *
 * Here are some examples, where the coefficients can always be variable,
 * so long as the sign remain positive or negative or oscillates pos-neg.
 * In the example, dim 1 is always the dimension with the flux.

/*!
 * \ingroup asgard_pde_definition
 * \brief One dimensional term, building block of separable operators
 *
 * \par Main usage
 * This class has two main modes of operation, first is as a single term representing
 * mass, div, grad, or penalty operation. The simple operations are best created
 * using the helper structs term_identity, term_mass, term_div and term_grad.
 *
 * \par
 * The second mode is to represent a chain of simple terms.
 * The operators in the chain will be multiplied together using small-matrix
 * logic in a local cell-by-cell algorithm.
 * Chains of partial terms are computationally more efficient than chains
 * of multidimensional terms, but have more restrictions on the types
 * of terms that can be chained:
 * - div or grad partial term with central flux can only chain with a mass term
 * - div or grad partial term with upwind/downwind flux can only chain with
 *   grad or div with opposing downwind/upwind flux
 * - a penalty term is equivalent to div/grad with central flux
 *
 * \par
 * Chain-of-chains is not allowed as it is unnecessary.
 *
 * \par Type-safety
 * ASGarD classes are templated to use either double or float precision, which can
 * create inconveniences with the C++ type system.
 * Consider the following code that creates a 1d mass term with coefficient 3.
 * \code
 *   // type explicitly set to float
 *   term_mass<float> fmass{3};
 *   // type explicitly set to double
 *   term_mass<double> dmass{3};
 *   // if double is available, type is double, else use float
 *   term_mass<asgard::default_precision> long_name_mass{3};
 *   // same as above but with less typing
 *   term_mass amass{3};
 * \endcode
 * In all cases the coefficient is set from a constant with type int and converted
 * to either float or double. Now take one more step and add the term to a 1D pde.
 * \code
 *   // assuming both double and float are available
 *   // the domain is 1d and the options are not important here
 *   asgard::PDEv2<float> fpde(options, domain1d);
 *
 *   // add mass term, type matches but uses lots of typing
 *   fpde += term_mass<float>{3};
 *
 *   // different types, there will be a conversion but that's fine
 *   // since ASGarD defaults to the higher precision, there may be an additional
 *   // (cheap) conversion of a single constant but no loss of precision
 *   fpde += term_mass{3};
 * \endcode
 * While this works fine for constants, it cannot be done if the coefficient is replaced
 * by a function, since there is no automatic conversion between std::vector<double>
 * and std::vector<float> and automatically doing such conversion is meaninglessly
 * expensive.
 * \code
 *   sfixed_func1d<float> rhs =
 *      [](std::vector<float> const &x, std::vector<float> &y)-> void {...};
 *
 *   // here mass will have type term_mass<float>
 *   auto mass = term_mass{rhs};
 *
 *   // using PDE of matching type
 *   PDEv2<float> fpde(options, domain1d);
 *
 *   fpde += term_1d{mass}; // OK, no need to explicitly specify 'float'
 *
 *   // creating PDE with default double precision
 *   PDEv2 pde(options, domain1d);
 *
 *   // rhs will not be converted to using std::vector<double>
 *   // a wrapper can be written but this has to be done explicitly
 *   // pde += term_1d<float> mass; // will fail to compile
 *   pde += term_1d{mass}; // will compile but yield runtime_error
 * \endcode
 * When using constant coefficients, ASGarD will handle most type conversion automatically
 * and when using variable coefficients the type does not need to be explicitly carried
 * for each template, which is convenient.
 * However, as a trade-off, when using variable coefficients and incorrect types sometimes
 * the error will occur at runtime, as opposed to compile time, since using constant vs.
 * variable coefficient is not known until runtime.
