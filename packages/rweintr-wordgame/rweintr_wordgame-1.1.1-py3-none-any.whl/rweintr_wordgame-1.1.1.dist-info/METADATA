# RWEINTR Guess the Word Game

The RWEINTR Guess the Word Game is a simple guessing game where the user gets to solve a randomly chosen hidden word by making letter guesses. The user has a configurable number of guesses to solve based on the level chosen by the user (Easy, Medium or Difficult). Higher levels of difficulty chosen get longer words with fewer allowed guesses. The user can enter a wild card "\*" character to try to guess the word before correctly entering all the word letters.

A score is automatically generated for each game played, based on the number of guesses needed and the difficulty level chosen. Each game result is automatically stored in a database. Statistics can be displayed after each game that includes a player's highest scores, score averages and number of wins (game where a player solves the word).
