- **[docs/architecture/](docs/architecture/)** - System design and architectural decisions
- **[docs/design/](docs/design/)** - Design documents and technical decision records
- **[docs/deployment/](docs/deployment/)** - Production deployment and operations

### 🟢 Documentation Guidelines for Developers

When working on the project:
- **Follow PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md** - See [docs/reference/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md](docs/reference/PROJECT_ORGANIZATION.md) for file placement rules
- **Update docs with code changes** - Documentation should stay current with implementation
- **Follow the structure** - Place new documentation in the appropriate section
- **Cross-reference related topics** - Use relative links to connect related information
- **Test all examples** - Ensure code samples work and produce expected output
- **Update index files** - Keep section README.md files current when adding new content

### Documentation Audience Focus

- **User Documentation** (`getting-started/`, `guides/`, `examples/`) - External users and administrators
- **Developer Documentation** (`developer/`, `architecture/`, `design/`) - Contributors and maintainers
- **Reference Documentation** (`reference/`) - Technical specifications for integration

## Key Development Guidelines

### 🔴 1. Code Quality Standards

When modifying code:
- **Always run linting and type checking** before committing:
  ```bash
  ruff check src/
  mypy src/
  black src/
  ```
- **Run tests** after making changes:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```
- **Follow existing code patterns** - check neighboring files for conventions

### 🔴 2. Identity Resolution

The project has a sophisticated developer identity resolution system:
- **Automatic Analysis**: Runs LLM-based identity analysis on first run (when no manual mappings exist)
- Handles multiple email addresses per developer
- Supports manual identity mappings in configuration
- Uses fuzzy matching with configurable threshold (default: 0.85)
- **Caching**: Identity analysis results are cached for 7 days to avoid re-running
- **Important**: When debugging identity issues, check `.gitflow-cache/identities.db`

#### Automatic Identity Analysis

The system now automatically analyzes developer identities **by default** when no manual mappings exist:
- Runs automatically during analysis (default command behavior)
- Prompts interactively for approval
- Updates configuration if approved
- Only prompts once every 7 days

```yaml
# Disable automatic analysis (enabled by default)
analysis:
  identity:
    auto_analysis: false
```

To skip identity analysis for a single run:
```bash
# Simplified syntax (default)
gitflow-analytics -c config.yaml --skip-identity-analysis

# Explicit analyze command
gitflow-analytics analyze -c config.yaml --skip-identity-analysis
```

To manually run identity analysis:
```bash
gitflow-analytics identities -c config.yaml
```

#### Display Name Control

Manual identity mappings now support an optional `name` field to control display names in reports:
```yaml
analysis:
  identity:
    manual_mappings:
      # Consolidate John Smith identities
      - name: "John Smith"  # Controls how name appears in reports
        primary_email: "john.smith@company.com"
        aliases:
          - "150280367+jsmith@users.noreply.github.com"
          - "jsmith-company@users.noreply.github.com"
```

This feature resolves duplicate entries when the same developer appears with different name formats. The structure supports both `primary_email` (preferred) and `canonical_email` (backward compatibility).

### 🔴 3. Caching System

The project uses SQLite for caching:
- Commit cache: `.gitflow-cache/gitflow_cache.db`
- Identity cache: `.gitflow-cache/identities.db`
- **Always provide `--clear-cache` option** when testing configuration changes

### 🔴 4. Configuration Management

Configuration uses YAML with environment variable support:
- Variables use format: `${VARIABLE_NAME}`
- **Environment files**: Automatically loads `.env` file from same directory as config YAML
- **Organization support**: `github.organization` field enables automatic repository discovery
- **Directory defaults**: Cache and reports now default to config file directory (not current working directory)
- Default ticket platform can be specified
- Branch mapping rules for project inference
- Manual identity mappings for consolidating developer identities
- Full backward compatibility with existing repository-based configurations

### 🟢 5. Default Command Behavior

GitFlow Analytics now uses `analyze` as the default command when no subcommand is specified:

- **Simplified syntax**: `gitflow-analytics -c config.yaml --weeks 8`
- **Explicit command**: `gitflow-analytics analyze -c config.yaml --weeks 8` (backward compatible)
- **Improved UX**: Users can omit the `analyze` subcommand for the most common operation
- **Developer impact**: Update examples and documentation to use simplified syntax as primary

#### Using .env Files

The system automatically looks for a `.env` file in the same directory as your configuration YAML:
```bash
# Example .env file
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
JIRA_ACCESS_USER=your.email@company.com
JIRA_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

This approach is recommended for:
- Keeping credentials out of configuration files
- Easy credential management across environments
- Preventing accidental credential commits

### 🟡 6. Report Generation

The system generates multiple report types:
- **CSV Reports**: Weekly metrics, developer stats, activity distribution, **untracked commits**
- **Markdown Reports**: Comprehensive narrative summaries with **restored multi-section format** and **enhanced untracked work analysis**
- **JSON Export**: Complete data export for API integration

#### Restored Narrative Report Sections

The narrative report system has been enhanced to include comprehensive sections:

**Core Sections (Always Present):**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level metrics, active projects list, top contributor
- **Team Composition**: Developer profiles with ALL project percentages, work styles, activity patterns
- **Project Activity**: Activity breakdown by project with contributor percentages within each project
- **Development Patterns**: Key insights from productivity and collaboration analysis
- **Issue Tracking**: Simplified platform usage display and coverage analysis
- **Enhanced Untracked Work Analysis**: Comprehensive categorization with dual percentage metrics
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights based on analysis patterns

**Conditional Sections:**
- **Qualitative Analysis**: LLM-generated insights (when ChatGPT integration is available)
- **Pull Request Analysis**: PR metrics (when PR data is available)
- **PM Platform Integration**: Story point tracking and correlation insights (when PM data is available)

#### Developer Project Percentage Calculation

The narrative report shows ALL projects each developer works on with precise percentages:

```python
# In _write_team_composition(), the system:
# 1. Looks for both _dev_pct and _pct patterns in focus data
# 2. Shows ALL projects with percentages, not just the primary project
# 3. Sorts by percentage descending for clear priority indication

# Example output:
# Projects: FRONTEND (85.0%), SERVICE_TS (15.0%)
```

This enhancement provides complete visibility into developer work distribution across projects.

#### Simplified Issue Tracking Display

The issue tracking section has been streamlined:
- **Platform Usage**: Clean display without complex nested metrics
- **Coverage Analysis**: Simple commit-to-ticket ratio
- **Enhanced Untracked Analysis**: Detailed but focused on actionable insights

This approach matches the original report format while maintaining enhanced analytical depth.

#### Enhanced Untracked Commit Analysis

The project now includes sophisticated untracked commit analysis with several key enhancements:

**Automatic Commit Categorization**: Uses regex pattern matching to classify commits into categories:
- `bug_fix`: Error corrections and fixes
- `feature`: New functionality development
- `refactor`: Code restructuring and optimization
- `documentation`: Documentation updates
- `maintenance`: Routine upkeep and dependencies
- `test`: Testing-related changes
- `style`: Formatting and linting
- `build`: Build system and CI/CD changes
- `other`: Uncategorized commits

**Configurable File Threshold**:
- Default threshold reduced from 3 to 1 file changed
- Configurable via `TicketExtractor` constructor parameter
- Filters out merge commits automatically
- Captures more granular untracked work patterns

**Enhanced Metadata Collection**:
- Full and abbreviated commit hashes
- Canonical developer identity resolution
- Project key for multi-repository analysis
- Detailed change metrics (files, lines added/removed)
- Commit categorization for pattern analysis
- Timestamp preservation for chronological analysis

**Dual Percentage Metrics**:
- Percentage of total untracked work (developer's share of all untracked commits)
- Percentage of developer's individual work (proportion of their commits that are untracked)
- Provides context for process improvement recommendations

**Process Recommendations**:
- Category-based recommendations (e.g., track features/bugs, accept maintenance)
- Developer-specific guidance identification
- Positive recognition for appropriate untracked work patterns

### 🟡 7. Testing Workflow

When testing changes:
1. Use the recess-recreo repositories as test data
2. Run with `--weeks 8` for consistent test periods
3. Check all report outputs for correctness
4. Verify identity resolution is working properly

### 🟢 8. Common Tasks

#### Adding a New Report Type

1. Create report generator in `src/gitflow_analytics/reports/`
2. Add to report generation pipeline in `cli.py`
3. Update configuration to support format selection
4. Document the report format in README

#### ⚪ Working with ML-Enhanced Commit Categorization

1. **Implementation Architecture**: The ML categorization system is built on top of the existing `TicketExtractor`:
   - `MLTicketExtractor` extends `TicketExtractor` with ML capabilities
   - Uses the existing qualitative analysis infrastructure (`ChangeTypeClassifier`)
   - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing reports and configurations

2. **Hybrid Classification Approach**:
   ```python
   # The system tries ML first, falls back to rules
   if ml_confidence >= hybrid_threshold:
       return ml_category
   else:
       return rule_based_category
   ```

3. **Key Components**:
   - **MLTicketExtractor**: Main entry point, extends TicketExtractor
   - **ChangeTypeClassifier**: Core ML logic using spaCy and semantic analysis
   - **MLPredictionCache**: SQLite-based caching for performance
   - **Semantic patterns**: Extensible keyword patterns for each category

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - **Caching**: ML predictions cached in SQLite for repeat analysis
   - **Batch processing**: Commits processed in configurable batches
   - **Lazy loading**: spaCy models loaded only when needed
   - **Graceful degradation**: Falls back to rule-based if ML fails

5. **Testing ML Categorization**:
   ```python
   from gitflow_analytics.extractors.ml_tickets import MLTicketExtractor

   # Create extractor with ML enabled
   extractor = MLTicketExtractor(enable_ml=True)

   # Test categorization with confidence
   result = extractor.categorize_commit_with_confidence(
       "fix: resolve memory leak in cache cleanup",
       files_changed=["src/cache.py"]
   )

   print(f"Category: {result['category']}")
   print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence']}")
   print(f"Method: {result['method']}")  # 'ml', 'rules', or 'cached'
   ```

6. **Extending Categories**: Add new semantic patterns to `ChangeTypeClassifier.change_patterns`
7. **Configuration**: ML behavior controlled via `ml_categorization` config section
8. **Debugging**: Use `get_ml_statistics()` method for performance insights

#### Working with Untracked Commit Analysis

1. **Extending Categorization**: Add new category patterns to `TicketExtractor.category_patterns`
2. **Customizing Thresholds**: Modify `untracked_file_threshold` in `TicketExtractor` constructor
3. **Adding Recommendations**: Extend `_generate_untracked_recommendations()` method
4. **Testing Categories**: Use `categorize_commit()` method to test pattern matching
5. **Report Customization**: Modify `generate_untracked_commits_report()` for additional fields

#### Adding a New Ticket Platform

1. Update regex patterns in `TicketExtractor`
2. Add platform to ticket counting logic
3. Test with sample commit messages
4. Update documentation

#### Debugging Identity Issues

1. Check identity database:
   ```bash
   sqlite3 .gitflow-cache/identities.db "SELECT * FROM developer_identities"
   ```
2. Review manual mappings in config
3. Clear cache and re-run analysis
4. Check for typos in email addresses

#### Debugging Narrative Report Generation

1. **Check Report Sections**: Verify all expected sections are generated:
   ```python
   # Debug narrative report generation
   from gitflow_analytics.reports.narrative_writer import NarrativeReportGenerator
   generator = NarrativeReportGenerator()

   # Check if PR data is available for PR analysis section
   if pr_metrics and pr_metrics.get('total_prs', 0) > 0:
       print("PR Analysis section will be included")

   # Check if PM data is available for PM integration section
   if pm_data and 'metrics' in pm_data:
       print("PM Platform Integration section will be included")
   ```

2. **Debug Developer Project Percentages**: Ensure focus data is correctly formatted:
   ```python
   # Check focus data structure for developer projects
   for dev in focus_data:
       print(f"Developer: {dev['developer']}")
       # Look for _dev_pct or _pct patterns
       project_keys = [k for k in dev.keys() if k.endswith('_dev_pct') or k.endswith('_pct')]
       print(f"Project percentage keys: {project_keys}")
   ```

3. **Validate Untracked Analysis Data**: Check untracked commits structure:
   ```python
   # Debug untracked commits analysis
   for commit in untracked_commits[:5]:  # Check first 5
       required_fields = ['hash', 'author', 'message', 'category', 'project_key']
       missing = [f for f in required_fields if f not in commit]
       if missing:
           print(f"Missing fields in commit {commit.get('hash', 'unknown')}: {missing}")
   ```

4. **Test Report Template Rendering**: Verify template string formatting:
   ```python
   # Test narrative templates
   generator = NarrativeReportGenerator()
   test_template = generator.templates['high_performer']
   result = test_template.format(name="Test Dev", commits=10, pct=25.5)
   print(f"Template result: {result}")
   ```

#### Debugging Untracked Commit Analysis

1. **Review Categorization Patterns**: Check if commit messages match expected patterns
   ```python
   # Example: Debug category matching
   from gitflow_analytics.extractors.tickets import TicketExtractor
   extractor = TicketExtractor()
   category = extractor.categorize_commit("fix: resolve login bug")
   # Should return "bug_fix"
   ```

2. **Inspect Untracked Commits CSV**: Review the generated `untracked_commits_YYYYMMDD.csv` for:
   - Unexpected categorizations
   - Missing commits (check file threshold)
   - Merge commits incorrectly included

3. **Validate File Threshold**: Adjust `untracked_file_threshold` parameter:
   ```python
   # Include all commits (threshold = 1)
   extractor = TicketExtractor(untracked_file_threshold=1)

   # Only significant commits (threshold = 3)
   extractor = TicketExtractor(untracked_file_threshold=3)
   ```

4. **Check Ticket Reference Detection**: Verify ticket patterns are matching correctly:
   ```bash
   # Search for commits that should have tickets but don't
   grep -E "(PROJ-|#[0-9]|CU-)" commit_messages.txt
   ```

5. **Review Developer Mapping**: Ensure canonical IDs are resolving correctly for dual percentage calculations

#### ⚪ Working with Organization Support

1. **Organization Discovery**: When `github.organization` is specified and no repositories are manually configured:
   - All non-archived repositories are automatically discovered from the GitHub organization
   - Repositories are cloned to local directories if they don't exist
   - Uses the organization name as the project key prefix if not specified

2. **Testing Organization Configs**:
   ```bash
   # Test with organization discovery (simplified syntax)
   gitflow-analytics -c config-org.yaml --weeks 4 --validate-only

   # Run with discovered repositories (simplified syntax)
   gitflow-analytics -c config-org.yaml --weeks 4

   # Explicit analyze command (backward compatibility)
   gitflow-analytics analyze -c config-org.yaml --weeks 4
   ```

3. **Directory Structure**: With organization support, the recommended directory structure is:
   ```
   /project/
   ├── config-org.yaml       # Organization config
   ├── repos/                # Auto-cloned repositories
   │   ├── repo1/
   │   ├── repo2/
   │   └── repo3/
   ├── .gitflow-cache/       # Cache (relative to config)
   └── reports/              # Reports (default output location)
   ```

4. **Debugging Organization Discovery**:
   - Check GitHub token has organization read permissions
   - Verify organization name is correct (case-sensitive)
   - Use `--validate-only` to test configuration without full analysis
   - Check for API rate limiting issues

### 🟢 9. Performance Considerations

- **Batch processing**: Commits are processed in batches (default: 1000)
- **Progress bars**: Use tqdm for long operations
- **Caching**: Aggressive caching to avoid re-processing
- **Memory usage**: Be mindful with large repositories

### 🟢 10. Error Handling

- **GitHub API errors**: Handle rate limiting and authentication failures gracefully
- **File system errors**: Check permissions and paths
- **Database locks**: Use proper session management with SQLAlchemy
- **Configuration errors**: Provide helpful error messages

### 🟢 11. Documentation Updates

When adding features:
1. Update README.md with user-facing changes
2. Update this file (CLAUDE.md) with developer notes
3. Add docstrings to all new functions/classes
4. Update configuration examples if needed

```

## 🟡 Atomic Versioning System

The project uses **python-semantic-release** for automated, atomic version management. This ensures consistency between the source code version, git tags, PyPI releases, and GitHub releases.

### Version Source of Truth

The single source of truth for versioning is:
- **File**: `src/gitflow_analytics/_version.py`
- **Format**: `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`
- **Management**: Automatically updated by semantic-release

### Semantic Versioning Rules

Version bumps are determined by conventional commit messages:
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes (rare, manual intervention required)
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features (`feat:` commits)
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes and maintenance (`fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.)

### Conventional Commit Format

Use these prefixes for automatic version detection:
```bash
# Minor version bump (new features)
feat: add new story point extraction pattern
feat(cli): add --validate-only flag for configuration testing

# Patch version bump (fixes, improvements, maintenance)
fix: resolve identity resolution bug with similar names
fix(cache): handle database lock errors gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
chore: update dependency versions
style: fix code formatting issues
refactor: improve error handling in GitHub client
perf: optimize commit batch processing
test: add integration tests for organization discovery
ci: update GitHub Actions workflow
build: update pyproject.toml configuration
```

### CLI Version Display Fix

The project includes a fix for proper CLI version display:
- Version is dynamically imported from `_version.py`
- CLI command `gitflow-analytics --version` correctly shows current version
- Prevents version mismatch between package and CLI

## 🟡 Automated Release Process

The project uses GitHub Actions for fully automated releases:

### Workflow Triggers
1. **Push to main branch**: Triggers semantic analysis
2. **Manual dispatch**: Can be triggered manually via GitHub UI
3. **Conventional commits**: Drive version bump decisions

### Release Steps (Automated)
1. **Semantic Analysis**: Analyze commits since last release
2. **Version Calculation**: Determine next version based on commit types
3. **Version Update**: Update `_version.py` with new version
4. **Git Operations**: Create git tag and GitHub release
5. **Quality Checks**: Run full test suite, linting, and type checking
6. **Package Build**: Build wheel and source distributions
7. **PyPI Publishing**: Automatically publish to PyPI
8. **Asset Upload**: Attach build artifacts to GitHub release
9. **Changelog**: Auto-generate and update CHANGELOG.md

### Manual Override (Emergency Only)

For emergency releases or version fixes:
```bash
# Only if semantic-release is not working
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Edit src/gitflow_analytics/_version.py manually
git commit -m "chore(release): manual version bump to X.Y.Z"
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Emergency release X.Y.Z"
git push origin main --tags
```

### GitHub Actions Configuration

The project includes comprehensive CI/CD:
- **`.github/workflows/semantic-release.yml`**: Main release workflow
- **`.github/workflows/tests.yml`**: Testing on multiple Python versions
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: Additional release validation

### PyPI Publishing

- **Trusted Publishing**: Uses GitHub's OIDC for secure PyPI publishing
- **No API Keys**: No need to manage PyPI tokens in secrets
- **Automatic**: Publishing happens on every version tag creation

### 🟢 12. YAML Configuration Error Handling

The project provides friendly YAML configuration error messages to help users quickly fix common issues.

#### Implementation Details

The `ConfigLoader` class in `config.py` includes comprehensive YAML error handling:

```python
def _handle_yaml_error(self, error: yaml.YAMLError, config_path: Path) -> str:
    """Generate user-friendly error messages for YAML parsing errors."""
```

The error handler detects and provides specific guidance for:
- **Tab characters** - Most common YAML error
- **Missing colons** - After key names
- **Unclosed quotes** - String delimiter issues
- **Invalid indentation** - Inconsistent spacing
- **Invalid escape sequences** - In string values

#### Extending Error Handling

To add new error patterns:

1. Add detection logic in `_handle_yaml_error()`:
```python
if "new_error_pattern" in str(error).lower():
    return self._format_error_message(
        config_path, error,
        "🚫 New error description!",
        "💡 Fix: Specific fix instructions"
    )
```

2. Add test cases in `tests/test_config.py`:
```python
def test_new_error_type(self):
    yaml_content = '''your test case'''
    # Test implementation
```

#### Error Message Format

All YAML error messages follow this structure:
- ❌ Clear error indicator
- 🚫 Specific problem identification
- 💡 Actionable fix suggestion
- 📍 Context from YAML parser
- 📁 File location
- 🔗 Help resources

## 🔴 Common Gotchas

1. **Timezone issues**: GitHub API returns timezone-aware timestamps, while database-stored datetimes may be timezone-naive. The system now ensures all datetime comparisons use UTC-aware timestamps
2. **Branch detection**: Simplified branch detection may not work for all workflows
3. **Memory usage**: Large repositories can consume significant memory
4. **Identity resolution**: Manual mappings must be applied after initial analysis
5. **Cache invalidation**: Some changes require clearing the cache
6. **Directory defaults**: Cache and reports now default to config file directory, not current working directory
7. **Organization permissions**: GitHub token must have organization read access for automatic repository discovery
8. **Version conflicts**: Never manually edit version in `_version.py` unless bypassing semantic-release
9. **Commit message format**: Incorrect commit message format will not trigger version bumps
10. **Release permissions**: Only repository owners can trigger releases (configured in workflow)
11. **Untracked commit threshold**: Default file threshold changed from 3 to 1 - may increase untracked commit counts
12. **Category matching**: Commit categorization is case-insensitive and uses regex - test patterns carefully
13. **Dual percentage metrics**: Require proper developer identity resolution to calculate individual work percentages
14. **Merge commit filtering**: Merge commits are automatically excluded from untracked analysis regardless of file changes
15. **ML model dependencies**: spaCy models must be downloaded separately (`python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`)
16. **ML graceful degradation**: System falls back to rule-based categorization if ML components fail to load
17. **ML cache location**: ML predictions cached in `.gitflow-cache/ml_predictions.db` - clear cache to reset ML results
18. **ML confidence thresholds**: Low confidence thresholds may result in poor categorizations, high thresholds fall back to rules more often
19. **spaCy model size**: Larger models (md, lg) provide better accuracy but use more memory and are slower to load
20. **Hybrid threshold tuning**: The `hybrid_threshold` balances ML vs rule-based usage - tune based on your commit message patterns
21. **YAML tab characters**: YAML files cannot contain tab characters - use spaces for indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
22. **YAML error messages**: Enhanced error handling provides specific fix suggestions for common YAML syntax errors
23. **Configuration validation**: Beyond YAML syntax, the system validates required fields and configuration structure
24. **Narrative report sections**: Some sections are conditional on data availability - missing PR data means no PR analysis section
25. **Developer project percentages**: Require proper focus data calculation - check for _dev_pct or _pct patterns in focus data
26. **Issue tracking display**: Platform usage section only appears when ticket_analysis contains ticket_summary data
27. **PM platform integration section**: Only included when pm_data is provided and contains 'metrics' key
28. **Untracked work recommendations**: Generated dynamically based on category analysis - categories dict must be properly populated
