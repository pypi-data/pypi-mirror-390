1.5.6 (2025-11-09)
====================

**Fixed**
- backport (https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic/pull/604) avoid assertion error when receiving multiple STOP_SENDING.
- backport (https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic/pull/603) limit the number of remote path challenges stored per path.
- backport (https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic/pull/606) update PATH_CHALLENGE / PATH_RESPONSE state after sending.
- backport (https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic/pull/606) send PATH_CHALLENGE before other frame types.
- backport (https://github.com/aiortc/aioquic/pull/590) remove stream objects when stream is ended.

**Changed**
- Various minor performance improvements in our Rust code.

**Misc**
- OCSP internals improved for better reliability (niquests usage only).

1.5.5 (2025-10-05)
====================

**Changed**
- Upgraded aws-lc-rs to v1.14.0
- Upgraded rustls to v0.23.32
- Upgraded pyo3 to v0.26.0

**Added**
- Explicit support for Python 3.14

**Misc**
- Initial support for pre-built RISCV wheels

1.5.4 (2025-08-11)
====================

**Changed**
- Upgraded aws-lc-rs to v1.13.3
- Upgraded rustls to v0.23.31

**Misc**
- OCSP and CRL related helpers improved. This is not useful for end users of qh3.

1.5.3 (2025-06-16)
====================

**Removed**
- The ``caextra`` recently added in the Configuration is reverted. After much consideration this was a mistake.
  End-users are already pushing either willingly or by accident intermediate CA or even non TLS client auth or server
  auth certificate in the regular CA bundle. We had to find another way.

**Changed**
- Caching the trust store loading in-memory to avoid unnecessary overhead on each TLS handshake.
- Upgraded pyo3 to 0.25.1

**Fixed**
- Aligned our TLS certificate chain validation with CPython+OpenSSL default behaviors. Pushing intermediates CA
  in the main CA bundle will still require that the trust anchors (root ca) is present.

**Misc**
- Changed CRL helpers and add the validation layer (signature).
- Added the validation layer to OCSP response (signature).

1.5.2 (2025-06-01)
====================

**Added**
- Passing extra intermediates CA in the configuration so that we could discretely rebuild the chain before validation.
  This is most useful in a corporate environment where server may misbehave and miss sending the full chain in the TLS handshake.
  The list of intermediate may be available in the OS trust store. It is not fetched automatically, you will have to provide
  them in the configuration. See the ``caextra`` property.

**Fixed**
- Default CA root list loading when none are given.

**Changed**
- Upgraded aws-lc-rs to 1.13.1
- Upgraded rustls to 0.23.27
- Upgraded pyo3 to 0.25.0

**Misc**
- Added CRL helpers.

- unclosed StreamWriter warning in our asyncio Protocol implementation.

1.4.4 (2025-04-11)
====================

**Misc**
- General performance improvements in various parts of the code. Up to 25% faster.

1.0.2 (2024-04-20)
=====================

**Fixed**
- qpack encoder/decoder blocking state in a rare condition.
- missing (a default) NullHandler for ``quic`` and ``http3`` loggers causing a StreamHandler to write into stderr.

1.0.0 (2024-04-18)
=====================

**Removed**
- **Breaking:** Dependency on ``cryptography`` along with the indirect dependencies on cffi and pycparser.
- **Breaking:** ``H0Connection`` class that was previously deprecated. Use either urllib3-future or niquests instead.
- **Breaking:** Draft support for QUIC and H3 protocols.

- **Breaking:** ED448/X448 signature and private key are no longer supported due to its absence in aws-lc-rs.
- **Breaking:** You may no longer pass certificates (along with private keys) as object that comes from ``cryptography``. You have to encode them into PEM format.

- cryptographic bindings are rewritten in Rust using the PyO3 SDK, the underlying crypto library is aws-lc-rs 1.6.4
- certificate chain control with dns name matching is delegated to rustls instead of previously half-vendored (py)OpenSSL (X509Store).

**Added**
- Exposed a public API for ``qh3`` (top-level import).
- SECP384R1 key exchange algorithm as a supported group by default to make for the X448 removal.
- SECP521R1 key exchange algorithm is also supported but not enabled by default per standards (NSA Suite B) recommendations.

**Misc**
- Noticeable performance improvement and memory safety thanks to the Rust migration. We tried to leverage pure Rust binding whenever we could do it safely.
- Example scripts are adapted for this major version.
- Using ``maturin`` as the build backend.
- Published new compatible architectures for pre-built wheels.
- Initial MSRV 1.75+

If you rely on one aspect of enumerated breaking changes, please pin qh3 to
exclude this major (eg. ``>=0.15,<1``) and inform us on how this release affected your program(s).
We will listen.

The semantic versioning will be respected excepted for the hazardous materials.
