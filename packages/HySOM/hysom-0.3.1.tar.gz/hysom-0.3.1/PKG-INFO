# HySOM

**Fast, lightweight Python library for training Self-Organizing Maps on 2D time series, tailored for analyzing concentration-discharge hysteresis loops.**  

**NOTE**: Currently, Python 3.14 is not yet supported due to missing precompiled dependencies. Please use Python 3.8–3.13. Support for Python 3.14 will be added shortly.

## Overview

**HySOM** is a Python library that simplifies the training and visualization of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for 2D time series. It is specifically designed for the study of concentration–discharge (C–Q) hysteresis loops. With **HySOM**, you can access the **General T-Q SOM**—a standard framework for classifying sediment transport hysteresis loops. The library also includes several visualization tools to streamline the analysis of sediment transport hysteresis loops. Additionally, **HySOM** allows you to train your own SOM for C–Q analysis.

## Features

- Direct access to the **General T-Q SOM** for sediment transport hysteresis loop analysis
- Tools for analyzing and classifying C-Q **hysteresis loops**
- **Visualization** utilities for SOM grids and hysteresis loops
- Easy, yet flexible, training of rectangular **Self-Organizing Maps** for 2D sequences
- Supports the **Dynamic Time Warping** distance function 
- Lightweight and dependency-minimized
