# Start
- This is learning project tested in Kali
- In Kali or any Linux, use this command to install
    - `pip install simple-http-fileserver`
- `simple-http-fileserver-cli.py` is the no GUI version.
- While `simple-http-fileserver.py` is with GUI.
- Tested in Kali and Windows10/11

# Intro
This Tool will run python based http GET and Post webserver.

Usage:
1. The server will list (GET) the content of the current directory where the app located:
    Browse the IP of the machine with the selected port `http://192.168.8.10:80`
    Or you can use one of the following in linux: \
    `wget http://192.168.8.10:80/` \
    Or:
    `curl http://192.168.8.10:80/`

1. The server will accept transferred files (POST) 
    and save them to current directory where the app located.
    You can use one of the following: \
    - Using curl \
    `curl.exe -X POST -H "X-Filename: nmap.exe" --data-binary "@C:\Users\kaled\Downloads\nmap-7.98-setup.exe" http://192.168.8.10:80/` \
    you will get `nmap.exe` after the upload. \
    Where: 
        - `-X` Use the HTTP POST method (send data in the request body).
        - `-H` "X-Filename: nmap.exe". Add a custom HTTP header named X-Filename with value nmap.exe (your server reads this to pick the filename to save).
        - `--data-binary "@C:\Users\kaled\Downloads\nmap-7.98-setup.exe"` Send the exact bytes of that local file as the HTTP request body. The @ tells curl to read the file contents.
        - `http://192.168.8.10:80/` The destination URL (IP and port 80).

    - Using wget \
    `wget --method=POST --header="X-Filename: test.txt" --header="Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --body-file="C:\Users\kaled\Downloads\somefile.txt" "http://192.168.8.10:80/"` \
    Where: \
        - `--method=POST` sets the method to POST.
        - `--header=...` sends the custom X-Filename header.
        - `test.txt` the file name after transferring, it can be anything like `key.pem`.
        - `--body-file=somefile.txt` sends the file as raw binary.
        - `somefile.txt` the file name before transferring, it should be exact.
