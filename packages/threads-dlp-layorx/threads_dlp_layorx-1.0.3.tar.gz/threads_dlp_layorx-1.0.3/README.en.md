A command-line tool designed for downloading videos from Threads.net. It integrates a full suite of features including scraping, downloading, database management, AI-powered metadata generation, automated YouTube uploading, and cloud deployment.

It doesn't rely on the official API or brittle HTML parsing. Instead, it uses **cookie-based authentication** to log in and **intelligently intercepts network traffic** to accurately capture videos. This approach ensures stable and efficient operation in a dynamic, login-required web environment.

The entire project has been fully containerized and configured for automated deployment on the **Zeabur** platform.

## ✨ Features

- **Secure Cookie Authentication**: No need to enter your username and password. Uses your browser's session cookie for secure login, protecting your account privacy.
- **Intelligent Network Sniffing**: Unlike traditional HTML scrapers, this tool directly analyzes network traffic to accurately capture video resources, resulting in a higher success rate.
- **Multi-Mode Scraping**: Supports scraping from a specific user's profile, keyword search results, or your personal home feed.
- **Automated Uploading**: Integrates with `youtubeuploader` to automatically upload downloaded videos to YouTube.
- **AI Smart Tags**: Uses the Google Gemini API to automatically generate titles, descriptions, and tags for videos.
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Supports multiple YouTube publishing strategies, including immediate, scheduled, and interval-based releases.
- **Database Management**: Uses SQLite to store video metadata, preventing duplicate downloads.
- **Web Dashboard**: Integrates `Datasette` to provide a web interface for browsing and querying the data stored in SQLite.
- **Cloud-Native**: Comes with a complete `Dockerfile` and `Procfile` for one-click deployment to container-supporting cloud platforms like [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/).

## Core Dependencies

### YouTube Uploader

The automated upload functionality of this project is powered by the excellent open-source tool [youtubeuploader](https://github.com/porjo/youtubeuploader), developed by [porjo](https://github.com/porjo).

#### Cross-Platform Strategy (Windows vs. Linux)

To balance the convenience of local development with the compatibility requirements of cloud deployment, we have adopted the following strategy:

- **Windows (Local Development):** The project repository directly includes the `youtubeuploader.exe` executable. When you run `uploader.py` in a Windows environment, it defaults to using this file, allowing you to test the upload functionality locally without extra setup.
- **Linux (Cloud Deployment):** The `Dockerfile` is configured to automatically download the latest **Linux (amd64)** version from the official `youtubeuploader` releases page during the Docker image build process. This ensures that the upload command executes correctly in Linux-based cloud environments like Zeabur.

This approach guarantees seamless use of the upload feature, whether you are developing locally or deploying to the cloud.

## 🚀 Local Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) installed

**Installation Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Project**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LayorX/threads-dlp.git
    cd threads-dlp
    ```

2.  **Install `uv`**
    `uv` is an extremely fast Python package manager.
    ```bash
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

3.  **Create Virtual Environment and Sync Dependencies**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

4.  **Set Up Environment Variables (`.env` file)**
    In the project root directory, create a file named `.env` and fill in the essential variables for local execution:
    ```env
    # Required: The sessionid cookie from Threads
    THREADS_SESSION_COOKIE="your_sessionid_here"

    # --- The following are for the auto-upload feature (optional) ---

    # Required: Google Gemini API Key
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

    # Optional: Paste the content of client_secrets.json as a single line
    YT_CLIENT_SECRETS='{"web":{"client_id":"...", "client_secret":"...", ...}}'

    # Optional: Paste the content of request.token as a single line
    YT_REQUEST='{"token": "...", "refresh_token": "...", ...}'
    ```
    > **Tip:** `YT_CLIENT_SECRETS` and `YT_REQUEST` are primarily designed for cloud deployment. For local development, you can simply place the `client_secrets.json` and `request.token` files in the project's root directory.

## 📖 Local Usage

Make sure you have activated the virtual environment (`.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows). The project consists of two main executable scripts: `main.py` (the primary downloader) and `uploader.py` (the standalone uploader).

### `main.py` (Downloader)

This is the main entry point for scraping and downloading videos. It can also trigger the upload process upon completion.

#### Arguments

| Short | Long | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-t` | `--target` | Specify the Threads username to scrape. | `None` (scrapes the home feed if omitted) |
| `-s` | `--search` | Scrape based on a search query instead of a user. | `None` |
| `-r` | `--scroll` | Number of times to scroll down the page for more content. | `3` |
| `-o` | `--output` | Specify the directory to save downloaded videos. | `downloads` |
| `-l` | `--language` | Set the language for log output. | `zh-TW` |
| `-u` | `--upload` | Automatically execute the uploader after download tasks are complete. | `False` |
| `-du`| `--deleteupload` | **(Requires `--upload`)** Sets the cleanup threshold (GB). If the `downloads` folder size exceeds this value, already **uploaded** video files will be automatically deleted to free up space. | `0.8` |
| `-n` | `--num_videos` | **(Requires `--upload`)** Specifies the maximum number of videos to upload. | Unlimited |
| `-d` | `--debug` | Enable detailed log output mode for debugging. | `False` |
| `-v` | `--version`| Show the current version of the program. | - |

#### Examples

**1. Download Videos from a Specific User (Basic)**
```bash
# Download videos from user 'zuck' with the default scroll count (3)
uv run python main.py -t zuck
```

**2. Specify Output Directory and Scrape Depth**
```bash
# Download from 'zuck', scroll 10 times, and save videos to the 'zuck_videos' folder
uv run python main.py -t zuck -r 10 -o zuck_videos
```

**3. Search and Download by Keyword**
```bash
# Search for "cats" and download the resulting videos
uv run python main.py -s "cats"
```

**4. Download from Your Home Feed**
```bash
# Simply run the script without -t or -s
uv run python main.py
```

**5. Download and Automatically Trigger Upload**
```bash
# Download videos from 'zuck' and start the upload process immediately after
uv run python main.py -t zuck -u
```

### `uploader.py` (Standalone Uploader)

This script checks the database for downloaded videos that have not yet been uploaded and publishes them to YouTube. It can be run independently to process a backlog of videos.

#### Arguments

| Short | Long | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-du`| `--deleteupload` | Sets the cleanup threshold (GB). If the `downloads` folder size exceeds this value, already **uploaded** video files will be automatically deleted to free up space. | `0.8` |
| `-n` | `--num_videos` | Specifies the maximum number of videos to upload in this run. | Unlimited |

#### Examples

**1. Run the Uploader with Default Cleanup Threshold**
```bash
# Check the database and upload pending videos.
# Before uploading, it checks if the 'downloads' folder exceeds 0.8 GB and cleans up if necessary.
uv run python uploader.py
```

**2. Run the Uploader with a Custom Cleanup Threshold**
```bash
# Set the cleanup threshold to 1.5 GB.
# Cleanup will only be triggered if the folder size is over 1.5 GB.
uv run python uploader.py -du 1.5
```

**3. Use Custom Cleanup Threshold in a Download-Upload Workflow**
```bash
# Download from 'zuck', then trigger the uploader.
# During the upload phase, use a 0.5 GB cleanup threshold.
uv run python main.py -t zuck --upload --deleteupload 0.5
```

### `view_db.py` (Database Viewer)

A simple utility to quickly view the database content in your terminal.

```bash
uv run python view_db.py
```

## 🔑 YouTube API Setup (for Auto-Upload Feature)

> **Important Note:**
> If your Google Cloud project's OAuth consent screen is in "Testing" status, the generated `request.token` will only be valid for **7 days**. To obtain a long-term valid token, you must "**Publish**" your application to production status in the Google Cloud Console. After publishing, you will need to regenerate `request.token` once.

To use the automatic YouTube upload feature (`--upload`), you must first complete the Google API authorization setup, following the official guide for `youtubeuploader`. This process involves two main steps: obtaining `client_secrets.json` and generating `request.token`.

### Step 1: Obtain `client_secrets.json`

This file acts as the "key" for your application, letting Google know it's your program making the upload requests.

1.  **Go to the Google Cloud Console**:
    *   Log in to your Google account and navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2.  **Create a New Project**:
    *   At the top of the page, click the project dropdown menu and select "New Project".
    *   Give the project a name (e.g., `Threads Uploader`) and click "Create".

3.  **Enable the YouTube Data API v3**:
    *   In the left navigation panel, go to "APIs & Services" > "Enabled APIs & services".
    *   Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" at the top.
    *   Search for "YouTube Data API v3", click on it, and then click "Enable".

4.  **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen**:
    *   In the left navigation panel, click on "OAuth consent screen".
    *   Choose "External" and click "Create".
    *   Fill in an application name (e.g., `My Uploader`) and select your email. You can leave the other fields blank for now.
    *   In the "Test users" step, click "+ ADD USERS" and **enter the email address of the Google account you will use for uploading videos**. This is a critical step; otherwise, the authorization will fail later.
    *   Save and continue until the setup is complete.

5.  **Create Credentials (OAuth Client ID)**:
    *   In the left navigation panel, click on "Credentials".
    *   Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" at the top and select "OAuth client ID".
    *   For "Application type", choose "**Web application**".
    *   Give it a name (e.g., `youtubeuploader-creds`).
    *   Under the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, click "+ ADD URI" and enter `http://localhost:8080/oauth2callback`.
    *   Click "Create".

6.  **Download the Credential File**:
    *   After creation, you will see the new client ID in your credentials list.
    *   Click the "Download JSON" icon on the far right.
    *   **Rename the downloaded file to `client_secrets.json`** and place it in the root directory of your `threads-dlp` project.

### Step 2: Generate `request.token`

This file is the "pass" that grants your application permission to act on behalf of your personal account.

1.  **Run an Upload Command Once**:
    *   Make sure `client_secrets.json` is in your project's root directory.
    *   Run a command that includes the upload flag in your terminal, for example:
        ```bash
        uv run python main.py zuck --upload
        ```
2.  **Complete the Browser Authorization**:
    *   The program will print a URL starting with `localhost` in your terminal and wait.
    *   **Copy this URL** and paste it into your browser.
    *   Log in with the same Google account you added as a "Test user".
    *   Grant the requested permissions.
    *   After authorization, the page will redirect to a `localhost` URL that cannot be reached. This is expected. **Copy this entire redirected URL from your browser's address bar**.
3.  **Paste the Authorization Code**:
    *   Return to your terminal. The program will be prompting you to paste the URL.
    *   Paste the URL you just copied and press Enter.
4.  **Token Generation**:
    *   Upon successful validation, the uploader will automatically generate a file named `request.token` in your project's root directory.

After completing these steps, your project will have full permission to upload videos automatically. Both `client_secrets.json` and `request.token` should be treated as confidential files and should never be committed to a public Git repository (the project's `.gitignore` already ignores them by default).

## ☁️ Zeabur Cloud Deployment Guide

This project is fully optimized for Zeabur, enabling one-click deployment and automated operation.

### Step 1: Fork the Project

Click the **Fork** button in the upper-right corner of this GitHub repository to copy this project to your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Create a Project on Zeabur

1.  Log in to the [Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/) console.
2.  Create a new project and authorize Zeabur to access your GitHub repositories.
3.  Select the `threads-dlp` repository you just forked to deploy.

### Step 3: Service Configuration and Start Commands

Zeabur will automatically detect the `Dockerfile` and deploy it as a service. It uses the `Procfile` to understand how to launch the different processes:

- **`web`**: Runs the `Datasette` service. Zeabur automatically injects the `PORT` environment variable and assigns a public domain name to it.
- **`worker`**: Runs the main scraper scheduler (`scheduler.py`). This is a background service that periodically executes scraping tasks according to the schedule.

You do not need to manually configure the start commands; Zeabur handles this automatically.

### Step 4: Configure Persistent Volumes (Very Important)

To ensure your database (`threads_dlp.db`) and downloaded videos are not lost when the service restarts, and to avoid unnecessary memory charges from using the ephemeral filesystem, you must mount a persistent volume for your storage paths.

1.  In your Zeabur project page, click on the **Volumes** tab.
2.  Click **Create Volume**.
3.  Create two volumes and mount them to the following paths respectively:
    *   **Mount Path 1:** `/home/appuser/db` (for storing the database file)
    *   **Mount Path 2:** `/home/appuser/downloads` (for storing downloaded videos)

> **Warning:** If you skip this step, all your downloaded videos and database records will be **permanently lost** every time the service restarts or redeploys.

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

This is the most critical step of the deployment. In your Zeabur project's **Variables** tab, add all of the following environment variables:

| Variable Name             | Description                                                                                                     | How to Obtain                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
