def find(signal, region, value, from_region=None, during=None):

    Like the function typhoon.test.signals.find_all, it finds the desired characteristic on the signal. The difference
    is that find function looks only for the first occurrence of described behaviour, while find_all function returns the
    list of all moments where that condition is met.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : pandas.Series
        Signal to be tested for.
    region : string
        Can be "at", "outside", "above" or "below". The option "outside" means "above" or "below".
    value : float or tuple
        Defines the region as a single number or range.
    from_region : string
        Defines which region the signal should be prior to the desired region. Use this to detect transitions.
    during : tuple
        Time period (as a range) to be considered for analysis.

    Returns
    -------
    result : Timedelta
        Time of detected behavior

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If the desired characteristic could not be detected.

    Examples
    --------
    First moment when Power is inside the range. Detects even if signal already starts in the range.

    >>> t = find(capture["P"], region="at", value=(900,1000))

    Almost same as before but require the signal to be outside the range prior entering it. Detects the transition to the range from above or below

    >>> t = find(capture["P"], region="at", value=(900,1000), from_region="outside")

    Detecting a rising edge, when power goes above 1000

            1. ``type``: specifies which kind of allure plot should be used. Valid values:

                * ``always`` - always adds specified plots

    Calculates important step characteristics of a given signal: rise time, settling time, overshoot, and others.

    This function works also for signals which does not start at zero (e.g. step change from x0 to x1, both
    different than 0).

    User can override initial values and final values. Overriding initial values are useful in the case of a response already starting at 0,
    and specifying final values is useful for noisy signals or responses with still oscillatory behaviour at the end of the signal.

    If the step does not start at 0 seconds of the capture, the initial time can be specified at 'evaluate_from_time'

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal: Pandas Series
        Signal to analyze
    settling_time_threshold: float
        Threshold/band, in percentage of the total step, around final value for computing the settling time. Default: 2%
    settling_time_threshold_abs: float
        Absolute threshold/band around final value for computing the settling time. If defined, overwrites 'settling_time_threshold'
    rise_time_thresholds: tuple of float
        Thresholds from which to compute the start and end of the rise time. Default: (0.1, 0.9)
    ss_during: tuple of float
        Defines the time interval, in seconds, to compute the average and ripple of the signal.
        If it is not defined, it will consider the time interval from the settling time until the end of the capture.
    initial_value_override: float
        Manually specifies initial value to consider (instead of the first signal value)
    final_value_override: float
        Manually specifies final value to consider (instead of the last signal value)
    evaluate_from_time : float
        Defines the starting time to evaluate the step in seconds
