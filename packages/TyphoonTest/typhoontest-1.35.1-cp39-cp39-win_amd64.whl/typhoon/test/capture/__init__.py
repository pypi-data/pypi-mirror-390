    """Sets up capture settings and start capture.

    It is a simplified version of regular Typhoon HIL API *start_capture()* function, with all the settings in just one function. It also omits some arguments that could be derived automatically.

    For more details refer to HIL API documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration
        Total capture duration, in seconds, including offset
    offset_absolute
        Duration in seconds of the data captured before the trigger. Can't be greater than ``duration``.
    offset_relative
        Relative duration, in percentage, of the data capture before the trigger. Can't be greater than 100.

        .. note::
            Users should only use either ``offset_absolute`` or ``offset_relative``. If both are defined, offset_relative will be used.

    rate
        Sampling rate in samples per second

        .. note::
            The sampling rate and duration can be arbitrarily defined, however they might not be valid depending on HIL constraints. When this is the case, the closest possible settings will be used, showed as a warning and returned from the function call.

    signals
        List of signals to be captured. No distinction is made between analog or digital as there cannot exist two signals with the same name

        .. note::
            At least one signal must be defined in ``signals`` list.

    trigger_source
        Signal to be used to trigger the capture

        .. note::
            ``trigger_source`` defaults to "Forced" if not defined. If defined with a value other than that, ``trigger_threshold`` and ``trigger_edge`` should be defined too.

    trigger_threshold
        Level the trigger_source signal should attain to start capture
    trigger_edge
        Direction of the trigger_source signal should have, when attaining trigger_threshold, to start capture. Can be
        "rising" or "falling".
    trigger_use_first_occurence
        If offset duration is larger than available before trigger, to consider only the amount available (setting to True) or ignore trigger and look for another one later on (setting to False).

        .. note::
            ``trigger_use_first_occurence`` should only be used as False when dealing with pure periodic signals and when offset should be strictly respected.

    fileName
        File name to save captured data

        .. note::
            Supported file formats are defined in hil api and can be seen here: https://www.typhoon-hil.com/documentation/typhoon-hil-api-documentation/hil_api.html?highlight=start_capture#typhoon.api.hil.start_capture

    executeAt
        If set, simulation time when this start_capture will take effect
    timeout
        Maximum allowed time to wait before a trigger
    absolute_time: bool
        Default is ``False``. If ``True``, the time index of capture time is the simulation time or the global time
        (See also ``typhoon.test.capture.get_capture_results`` documentation).
        If ``False``, the time index of capture time is relative.

        .. note::
            For the future releases this parameter will be **deprecated**.

    Returns
    -------
    namedtuple(t, duration, rate): tuple
        With the following attributes:

        - **t** (*NoneType*): The time of the capture start (Deprecated)
        - **duration** (*float*): Adjusted capture duration
        - **rate**: (*float*): Rate based on system constraints.

    Examples
    --------
    Forced capture start, printing returned values:

    >>> from typhoon.test.capture import start_capture
    >>> capture_info = start_capture(duration=10, rate=10000)
    >>> print(capture_info.t)
    >>> print(capture_info.duration)
    >>> print(capture_info.rate)

    No offset, using analog signal as trigger:

    >>> start_capture(duration=rtspec.duration+2,
                      rate=500,
                      signals=["Probe val", "enable inv", "enable ref"],
                      trigger_source="Probe val",

                      trigger_threshold=277
                      timeout=10)

    Using absolute offset and trigger on digital signal:

    >>> start_capture(duration=4,

    sleep
        To avoid busy waiting, defines the time between polls for capture finish.

    -------
    time : Timedelta
        Time after capture has finished.

def get_capture_results(wait_capture=False, time_format="relative"):
    """
    Return capture results as a Pandas DataFrame.

    Parameters
    ----------
    wait_capture
        If True, blocks until capture finishes. If False, immediately stops capture and return captured results so far.

    time_format: str
        Default is None. The available options are ``'relative'``, ``'sim_absolute'``, and ``'global_absolute'``.

            - If ``'relative'``, the time index of the capture is relative to this function call.
            - If ``'sim_absolute'``, the time index of the capture is the simulation time.
            - If ``'global_absolute'``, the time index of the capture is the HIL Device synchronized time.

        If this parameter is not defined the behavior will be dependent of the ``absolute_time`` parameter of the
        `typhoon.test.capture.start_capture` function previously defined. If ``absolute_time = False`` the time format
        used will be ``'relative'``, otherwise if ``absolute_time = True`` the time format used will be ``sim_absolute``.

        .. note::
            The ``'global_absolute'`` will be effective only if the HIL Device is already synchronized (PTP or IRIG-B).
            Otherwise, the exception ``GlobalTimeSyncError`` will be raised.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        All captured signals, selectable by name, with time index

    Raises
    ------
        GlobalTimeSyncError: Raised when ``timeFormat = 'global_absolute'`` is used on the function
        ``typhoon.test.capture.start_capture`` and the HIL Device is not synchronized.

    Examples
    --------
    Importing libraries

    >>> from typhoon.test.capture import start_capture, get_capture_results

    Returning results immediately

    >>> start_capture(duration=20, rate=100000, signals=["P", "Va_rms"])
    >>> # do something in meantime which takes 10 seconds...
    >>> capture = get_capture_results() # returns capture up to 10 seconds

    Waiting whole capture duration

    >>> start_capture(duration=20, rate=100000, signals=["P", "Va_rms"])
    >>> # do something in meantime which takes 10 seconds...
    >>> capture = get_capture_results(wait_capture=True) # waits until the 20 second capture elapses

    Individual signals can be accessed in a dict-like fashion:

    >>> print(capture) #pandas DataFrame
    >>> print(capture["P"]) #pandas Series

    The values can be accessed using:

    >>> capture["P"].values # return array

    The index is a TimedeltaIndex, which contains Typhoon custom Timedeltas:

    >>> index = capture["P"].index
    >>> index[0] # Time for first point (Timedelta)
    >>> index[0].total_seconds() # returns a float with time as seconds

    You can slice using time directly using time, for example here from 10 seconds onwards:

    >>> capture["P"]["10s":]

    Some TyphoonTest functions return timedeltas, which also can be used for slicing:

    >>> from typhoon.test.signals import find
    >>> t_fullpower = find(capture["P"], region="at", value=100000)
    >>> capture["P"][t_fullpower-"1s":t_fullpower] # slices the period 1 second before t_fullpower

    Other DataFrame and Series example

    >>> from typhoon.test.signals import pandas_3ph_sine
    >>> df = pandas_3ph_sine()
    >>> df
    >>> sine1 = df["sine1"]
    >>> sine1

    Parameters
    ----------
    name
        Same as find function (see below)
    region

    from_region
        Same as find function (see below)
    interval
        Time between reads of the signal.
    timeout
        Time after which, if the signals has not yet met the desired behavior, function will fail.

    Returns
    -------
    Timedelta
        Time when signal meets the behavior

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If timeout is reached without meeting the behavior.

    Examples
    --------

    First moment when Power is inside the range, polling every one second, fails if not satisfied within 10 seconds. Detects even if signal already starts in the range.

    >>> t = wait_until("P", region="at", value=(900,1000), interval=1, timeout=10)

    Almost same as before but require the signal to be outside the range prior entering it. Detects the transition to the range from above or below

    >>> t = wait_until("P", region="at", value=(900,1000), from_region="outside", interval=1, timeout=10)

    Detecting a rising edge, when power goes above 1000

    >>> t = wait_until("P", region="above", value=1000, from_region="below", interval=1, timeout=10)

    Notes
    -----
    This behaves very similarly to the find() function from analysis module. The difference is that this one executes in real-time, whereas the find() function checks an already captured signal.

def merge_dataframes(left, right, interpolation_method="time", rename_repeated=False):
    """
    Merge two DataFrame objects with a database-style join. This function is wrapper around pandas.DataFrame.merge
    and pandas.DataFrame.resample functions:
    https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html and
    https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html.
    Join is done on indexes of DataFrames, which should both be pandas.Timedelta.
    The 'right' DataFrame is merged to the left by using outer join style to preserve all the data for interpolation,
    which comes consequently. After that, dataframe is resampled with time between first two samples of the left dataframe
    used as sample time. If left dataframe has syncronous data (and it is good practice to put synchronous dataframe as
    left), the resulting dataframe would have the same indices as the left.
    First valid value is used to replace all NaN values before it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left: pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame object used on the left side of the join operation
    right: pandas.DataFrame
        DataFrame object used on the right side of the join operation
    interpolation_method: {'time', 'pad'}, default 'time'
        Method to replace NaN values after the first valid value. Available methods:

        * | 'time': same argument from pandas.DataFrame.interpolate: `link <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.interpolate.html>`_
          | It can be viewed as piece-wise linear interpolation based on pandas.Timedelta index of the DataFrame: Gap is filled by doing linear interpolation between the previous and the next valid value.
        * | 'pad': This method is using existing values to fill in NaNs.
          | The last valid observation is used to fill the gap.

    rename_repeated: bool, default False
        * False: If 'left' and 'right' DataFrames have any columns with the same name, a NameError Exception is raised.
        * | True: If 'left' and 'right' DataFrames have any columns with the same name, they are renamed.
          | It is attached '_x' and '_y' to the end of their names, respectively.
