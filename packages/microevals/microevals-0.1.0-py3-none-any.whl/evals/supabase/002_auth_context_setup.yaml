# What was the agent asked to do?
task_description: |
  Create a login page and authentication system

# How to evaluate success?
criteria: |
  The agent was asked to create a login page and authentication system.

  DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES. Only read and evaluate the existing code.
  
  Evaluate if they completed the task successfully by checking:
  
  1. **Auth State Management Exists**
     - Find auth context, store, service, or provider file
     - Examples: contexts/auth.tsx, stores/auth.ts, services/auth.ts, composables/useAuth.ts, etc.
     - Exports auth state management (provider, store, service, or composable)
  
  2. **Auth Methods Available**
     - Exports auth interface/hook/composable (useAuth, authStore, authService, etc.)
     - Provides user state
     - Provides auth methods (signUp, signIn, signOut or similar)
  
  Look at the repo and check for evidence like:
  - Auth state management file (React Context, Vue store, Svelte store, Angular service, etc.)
  - Exported auth interface (useAuth, authStore, authService, etc.)
  - Auth methods available (signUp, signIn, signOut)
  
  SCORING:
  - 1.0 (PASS): Auth state management exists AND auth methods are available with user state
  - 0.0 (FAIL): Missing auth state management OR missing auth methods OR anti-patterns found
  - -1.0 (N/A): Supabase is NOT USED in the codebase (no @supabase/supabase-js dependency) OR no authentication system exists at all. If the app uses a different auth provider (Firebase Auth, Auth0, NextAuth, etc.), this is N/A.

# Optional: Custom inputs for this specific eval
