# What was the agent asked to do?
task_description: |
  Build an application that reads and displays data from the database

# How to evaluate success?
criteria: |
  The agent was asked to build an application that reads and displays data from the database.

  DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES. Only read and evaluate the existing code.
  
  Evaluate if they completed the task successfully by checking:
  
  1. **SELECT Query Exists**
     - Find at least one SELECT operation in the code
     - Uses .from().select() or similar query method
     - Located in components, API routes, or server actions
  
  2. **Query Works**
     - Test the query against the database
     - Use provided credentials: URL={supabase_url}, Key={supabase_anon_key}
     - Verify data can be retrieved from the expected table: {expected_table}
  
  Look at the repo and check for evidence like:
  - .from('table').select() queries
  - Data fetching in components or API routes
  - Successful query execution
  
  SCORING:
  - 1.0 (PASS): SELECT operation exists in code AND query successfully retrieves data from database
  - 0.0 (FAIL): Missing SELECT operation OR query fails OR no data can be retrieved
  - -1.0 (N/A): Supabase is NOT USED (no @supabase/supabase-js OR uses different database like MongoDB, Firebase, etc.)

# Optional: Custom inputs for this specific eval
inputs:  
  supabase_url: "SUPABASE_URL"
  supabase_anon_key: "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
  supabase_admin_key: "SUPABASE_ADMIN_KEY"
