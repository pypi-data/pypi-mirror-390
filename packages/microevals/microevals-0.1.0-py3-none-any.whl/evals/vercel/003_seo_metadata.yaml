category: vercel

criteria: |
  Evaluate the application's SEO and social sharing metadata. Use a balanced scoring approach where having most SEO elements is sufficient for a passing score.
  
  Check for these elements (award points for presence):
  - Page titles using Metadata API or next/head [High priority]
  - Meta descriptions for key pages [High priority]
  - Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image) [Medium priority]
  - Twitter Card tags for social sharing [Low priority]
  - Canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content [Medium priority]
  - Structured data (JSON-LD) [Low priority]
  - Robots.txt and sitemap.xml generation [Medium priority]
  - Alt text on images for accessibility [High priority]
  
  Mark as PASS if the app has MOST of the good stuff:
  - Has at least 4-5 of the 8 elements above (simple majority)
  - Shows clear SEO effort (titles and descriptions present)
  - Missing a few low-priority items is acceptable
  - The positives clearly outweigh any gaps
  
  Mark as FAIL only if severely lacking:
  - Missing most high-priority items (no titles AND no descriptions)
  - Has fewer than 3 total SEO elements
  - Shows no SEO consideration whatsoever
  
  When in doubt, favor PASS if reasonable SEO effort is evident.
