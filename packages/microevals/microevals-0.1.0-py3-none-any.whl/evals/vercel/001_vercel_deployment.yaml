name: "Vercel Deployment"
description: "Check if deployed site is live and matches the codebase"
category: vercel

criteria: |
  Curl {deployment_url} and verify deployment is working. Check HTTP 200, valid HTML, no error pages.
  
  If the repository has source code, also verify the deployed content matches the codebase - compare
  HTML against components/routes/framework markers. If repo is empty or has no code, just verify
  the site loads successfully.
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): Site loads successfully (HTTP 200) AND content matches codebase (or no code to match)
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Errors, broken deployment, or content completely different from codebase
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No deployment URL provided
