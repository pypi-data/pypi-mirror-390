eval_id: nextjs_client_component_002
name: "Client Component with State"
description: "Validates proper client component implementation with React state management"
category: nextjs

criteria: |
  You have access to the entire codebase. Evaluate if components using React hooks have the 'use client' directive.
  
  CONTEXT: This eval applies to Next.js App Router codebases using React hooks.
  
  WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
  Find any files that import and use React hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer, etc.)
  
  ANTI-PATTERN (mark as failed):
  - File uses useState, useEffect, or other React hooks but is missing 'use client' directive at top
  - Component in app/ directory uses hooks without 'use client'
  
  CORRECT PATTERN (mark as passed):
  - All components using hooks have 'use client' at the top of the file
  - Or they properly import client components that handle the hooks
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): All components using React hooks have 'use client' directive, no anti-patterns found
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Components use React hooks without 'use client' directive
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No Next.js App Router OR no components use React hooks OR using Pages Router
