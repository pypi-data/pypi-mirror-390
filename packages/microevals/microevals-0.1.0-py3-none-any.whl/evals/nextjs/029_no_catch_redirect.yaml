  You have access to the entire codebase. Look for a subtle but critical bug.
  
  CONTEXT: redirect() and notFound() work by throwing special errors that Next.js catches.
  
  WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
  Find any try-catch blocks that contain redirect() or notFound() calls.
  
  ANTI-PATTERN (mark as failed - THIS IS A BUG):
  - try { redirect('/login') } catch (e) { ... }
  - try { if (condition) notFound() } catch (error) { ... }
  - Catching the error prevents Next.js from handling navigation
  - Results in broken redirects or 404 pages not showing
  
  CORRECT PATTERN (mark as passed):
  - redirect() and notFound() are NOT inside try-catch blocks
  - If you need validation, do it BEFORE calling redirect/notFound
  - Let these functions throw - Next.js will catch them correctly
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): redirect() and notFound() are NOT inside try-catch blocks, no anti-patterns found
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Anti-pattern found - redirect() or notFound() called inside try-catch (THIS IS A BUG that breaks navigation)
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No usage of redirect() or notFound() OR no Next.js App Router
  
  NOTE: This is a subtle bug that makes navigation silently fail.
