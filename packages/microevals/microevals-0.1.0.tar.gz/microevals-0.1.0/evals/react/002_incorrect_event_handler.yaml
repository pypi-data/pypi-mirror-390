name: "Incorrect Event Handler Syntax"
description: "Checks for event handlers that are called immediately instead of on event"
category: react

criteria: |
  Detect event handlers with incorrect syntax causing immediate execution.
  
  ANTI-PATTERN:
  - onClick={handleClick()} // calls immediately, not on click
  - onChange={setValue(e.target.value)} // calls during render
  - onSubmit={submitForm(data)} // calls immediately
  
  WHY IT'S WRONG:
  - Function executes during render, not on event
  - Infinite render loops if it updates state
  - Common LLM mistake
  
  CORRECT:
  - onClick={handleClick} // pass reference
  - onClick={() => handleClick()} // arrow function wrapper
  - onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} // arrow function
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): Event handlers exist AND all use correct syntax (no immediate execution)
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Event handlers exist BUT incorrect syntax found (list specific locations)
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No event handlers found in codebase
