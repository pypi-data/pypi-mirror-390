name: "Environment Variables Configuration"
description: "Verify the application properly handles environment variables for Vercel deployment"
category: vercel

criteria: |
  Evaluate how the application handles environment variables in a Vercel deployment context.
  
  Check if the app demonstrates proper env var usage:
  - Public vars prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ for client access
  - Sensitive vars (API keys, secrets) NOT prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
  - Graceful handling of missing environment variables
  - No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
  - Proper use of process.env with fallbacks where appropriate
  - .env.example or documentation showing required vars
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): Environment variables properly scoped, no exposed secrets, graceful handling, clear documentation
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Secrets exposed with NEXT_PUBLIC_, hardcoded API keys, app crashes when vars missing, or no documentation
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No environment variables used in the application
