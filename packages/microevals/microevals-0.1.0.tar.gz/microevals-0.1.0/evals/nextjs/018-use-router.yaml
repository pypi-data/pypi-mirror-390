criteria: |
  You have access to the entire codebase. Evaluate if useRouter is imported from the correct package.
  
  CONTEXT: This eval applies to Next.js App Router codebases using programmatic navigation.
  
  WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
  Find any imports of useRouter hook.
  
  ANTI-PATTERN (mark as failed):
  - Importing useRouter from 'next/router' in App Router app/ directory
  - Using window.location.href = '...' for Next.js navigation
  - Missing 'use client' in file that uses useRouter
  
  CORRECT PATTERN (mark as passed):
  - Imports useRouter from 'next/navigation' (App Router)
  - File has 'use client' directive
  - Uses router.push(), router.back(), router.refresh() correctly
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): useRouter imported from 'next/navigation' with 'use client' directive, no anti-patterns found
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Anti-patterns found (importing from 'next/router' in App Router, window.location, missing 'use client')
