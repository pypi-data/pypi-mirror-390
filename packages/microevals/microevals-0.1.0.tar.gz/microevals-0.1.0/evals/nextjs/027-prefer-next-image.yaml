name: "Prefer Next.js Image Component"
description: "Validates using Next.js Image instead of img tags for image optimization"
category: nextjs

criteria: |
  You have access to the entire codebase. Evaluate if images are using Next.js optimization.
  
  CONTEXT: This eval applies to Next.js projects displaying images.
  
  WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
  Find <img> tags or Image components in the codebase.
  
  ANTI-PATTERN (mark as failed):
  - Using <img> tags instead of Next.js Image component
  - Hardcoded image paths without optimization
  - Missing required props (width, height, alt) on Image component
  
  CORRECT PATTERN (mark as passed):
  - Import Image from 'next/image'
  - Use <Image src="..." alt="..." width={X} height={Y} />
  - All images have proper alt text for accessibility
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): All images use Next.js Image component with proper props, no anti-patterns found
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Anti-patterns found (using <img> tags, missing required props on Image, no alt text)
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No images displayed OR images are only SVGs OR not using Next.js
  
  NOTE: This is an optimization, not a bug. <img> works but misses Next.js optimizations.
