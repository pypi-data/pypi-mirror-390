  Check for Pages Router patterns in App Router apps.
  
  OLD PATTERNS (Pages Router):
  - pages/ directory with route files
  - _app.js, _document.js special files
  - getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, getInitialProps
  - import from 'next/router' (should use 'next/navigation')
  
  WHY IT'S WRONG:
  - Mixing routers causes confusion and bugs
  - App Router patterns don't work in Pages Router files
  - Different mental models for routing and data fetching
  - Can't leverage new App Router features
  
  CORRECT APPROACH (App Router):
  - app/ directory with route folders
  - layout.js, page.js, loading.js, error.js
  - Server components with async/await
  - import from 'next/navigation' (useRouter, usePathname, etc.)
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): Fully migrated to App Router - no Pages Router patterns
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): App Router exists but old Pages Router patterns still present
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No app/ directory exists (pure Pages Router app, which is fine for legacy apps)
