name: "Correct Content Paths in Tailwind Config"
description: "Checks if tailwind.config content paths include all files using Tailwind classes"
category: tailwind

criteria: |
  Verify content paths in tailwind.config include all files with Tailwind classes.
  
  ANTI-PATTERN:
  - content: ['./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}'] but components are in /components
  - Missing file extensions (.mdx, .vue, etc.)
  - Hardcoded paths that don't match actual file structure
  
  WHY IT'S WRONG:
  - Classes in files not matched by content paths get purged in production
  - Styles work in dev but break in production build
  - Silent failure - no error, just missing styles
  
  CORRECT:
  - content: ['./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}', './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}']
  - Include all directories and extensions where Tailwind is used
  
  SCORING:
  - Score 1.0 (PASS): Tailwind config exists AND content paths correctly include all files with Tailwind classes
  - Score 0.0 (FAIL): Tailwind config exists BUT files with classes are outside content paths (anti-pattern)
  - Score -1.0 (N/A): No Tailwind config found in project
