# What was the agent asked to do?
task_description: |
  Create a login page and authentication system

# How to evaluate success?
criteria: |
  The agent was asked to create a login page and authentication system.

  DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES. Only read and evaluate the existing code.
  
  Evaluate if they completed the task successfully by checking:
  
  1. **Sign Up Implementation**
     - Uses supabase.auth.signUp() or similar
     - Accepts email and password
  
  2. **Sign In Implementation**
     - Uses supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() or similar
     - Accepts email and password
  
  3. **Sign Out Implementation**
     - Uses supabase.auth.signOut()
     - Clears session properly
  
  Look at the repo and check for evidence like:
  - Auth context or auth service with signUp method
  - Auth context or auth service with signIn method
  - Auth context or auth service with signOut method
  - Proper Supabase auth API usage
  
  SCORING:
  - 1.0 (PASS): All three auth methods (signUp, signIn, signOut) are properly implemented with correct Supabase API usage
  - 0.0 (FAIL): Missing any of the three auth methods OR incorrect implementation OR anti-patterns found
  - -1.0 (N/A): Supabase auth is NOT USED (no @supabase/supabase-js OR uses different auth provider like Firebase, Auth0, NextAuth)

# Optional: Custom inputs for this specific eval
inputs:  
  supabase_url: "SUPABASE_URL"
  supabase_anon_key: "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
