# What was the agent asked to do?
task_description: |
  Create a login page and authentication system

# How to evaluate success?
criteria: |
  The agent was asked to create a login page and authentication system. Test if it actually works.

  DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES. Only read and evaluate the existing code.
  
  Evaluate if the authentication works by testing:
  
  1. **Sign Up Works**
     - Test account creation with new email/password
     - Verify account is created in Supabase
     - Use provided credentials: URL={supabase_url}, Key={supabase_admin_key}
  
  2. **Sign In Works**
     - Test login with test account: {test_email} / {test_password}
     - Verify session is created
     - User state is updated
  
  3. **Sign Out Works**
     - Test logout functionality
     - Verify session is cleared
     - User state is reset
  
  Look at the repo and check for evidence like:
  - Start the application
  - Test the complete authentication flow
  - Verify auth state changes correctly
  - Check Supabase dashboard for user creation
  
  SCORING:
  - 1.0 (PASS): All three operations work (signUp, signIn, signOut) when tested live with provided credentials
  - 0.0 (FAIL): Any of the three operations fail OR unable to test OR authentication errors
  - -1.0 (N/A): Cannot test authentication flow (app doesn't run, no test environment, or auth not implemented)
