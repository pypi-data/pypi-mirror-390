name: "Required Component Peer Dependencies"
description: "Checks if peer dependencies are installed for shadcn components that require them"
category: shadcn

criteria: |
  Verify peer dependencies for shadcn components that require them.
  
  ANTI-PATTERN:
  - Using Form component without react-hook-form and zod
  - Using Calendar without date-fns or day.js
  - Using Sonner toast without sonner package
  - Using Command without cmdk
  
  WHY IT'S WRONG:
  - Runtime error: "Cannot find module 'react-hook-form'"
  - Components crash when dependencies missing
  - Each specialized component has specific requirements
  
  CORRECT:
  - Form needs: react-hook-form, zod, @hookform/resolvers
  - Calendar needs: react-day-picker, date-fns
  - Command needs: cmdk
  - Sonner needs: sonner
  - Check shadcn docs for each component's requirements
  
  EVALUATION:
  - Detect which shadcn components are used
  - Check if required dependencies are in package.json
  - If component used without dependency: score 0.0
  - If no components with dependencies: score -1.0 (N/A)
