        to. Since the span of time is relative to each of the two periods, this method will always return different
        intervals.

        Take, for example, the following two periods:
        >>> period1_start = date(2024, 1, 1)
        >>> period1_end = date(2024, 1, 10)

        >>> period2
        DatePeriod(start=datetime.date(2024, 1, 5), end=datetime.date(2024, 1, 15))

        On a timeline, the two periods can be illustrated as:
        2024-01-01      Period 1                2024-01-10

        From the point of view of Period 1, the disconnect between the two periods is between the 1st and the 5th;
        however, from the point of view of Period 2, the disconnect between them is between the 10th and the 15th.

        Therefore, if you want to obtain the amount of time when the periods do NOT overlap as relative to Period 1,
        you should use:

        DatePeriod(start=datetime.date(2024, 1, 1), end=datetime.date(2024, 1, 5))

        On a timeline, the two periods can be illustrated as:

        however, from the point of view of Period 2, the disconnect between them is between the time 1200 and 1300.

        Therefore, if you want to obtain the amount of time when the periods do NOT overlap as relative to Period 1,
