# 🧹 pyprint-cleaner

**pyprint-cleaner** is a simple yet powerful developer utility that automatically **comments out** or **uncomments** all `print()` statements in your Python project.

This helps you keep your production code clean while easily restoring debug logs when needed.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Recursively scan your entire project for `print()` statements  
✅ Automatically comment them out safely with backups  
✅ Revert them anytime with one command  
✅ Never touches your docstrings or existing comments  
✅ CLI support (`comment-prints` and `uncomment-prints`)  
✅ Cross-platform and zero dependencies

---

pip install pyprint-cleaner
```

## 🧩 Usage

### Comment all `print()` statements

```bash
comment-prints
```
You’ll be prompted for your project directory.

## 💡 Example

```python
print("Debug start")
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# print("already commented")
```

After running `comment-prints`:
```python
# [auto] print("Debug start")
for i in range(5):
    # [auto] print(i)
# print("already commented")
```
