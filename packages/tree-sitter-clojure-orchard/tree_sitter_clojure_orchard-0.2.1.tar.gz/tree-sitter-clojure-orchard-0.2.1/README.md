This is a fork of the [tree-sitter-clojure](https://github.com/sogaiu/tree-sitter-clojure) grammar.

Note that unlike upstream, generated files are not checked into git, so you need to run `tree-sitter generate` after cloning this repository.
Generated files are also available in the archives found in releases.

Contributions are welcome, so are co-maintainers.
