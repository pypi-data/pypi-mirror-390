# Changelog

## [0.4.5] - 2025-11-09

- Enhanced comment paragraph separation: preserve blank lines directly adjacent to comments
  - Blank lines between comment blocks are now preserved (comment paragraphs)
  - Blank lines immediately before/after comments are preserved (user intent)
  - Scope boundaries still take precedence (no blank lines at start of scope)

## [0.4.4] - 2025-10-16

- Fixed parser incorrectly treating apostrophes in comments as string delimiters
  - Comments with contractions (e.g., "don't", "can't") were causing massive parsing failures
  - Parser now stops processing when it encounters '#' outside of strings
  - This bug caused entire files to be mis-parsed as single giant statements

## [0.4.3] - 2025-10-16

- Fixed consecutive `async def` test functions not getting proper PEP 8 spacing
  - Parser now correctly recognizes `async def` as ending a decorator sequence
  - Consecutive module-level async function definitions now properly separated by 2 blank lines

## [0.4.2] - 2025-10-16

- Fixed dictionary assignments with string keys being misclassified as CALL
  - `environ['KEY'] = value` now correctly classified as ASSIGNMENT
  - Prevents incorrect blank lines being added between consecutive dictionary assignments

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-14

- Updated `--check` mode output to "All checks passed!" when no formatting changes needed (matches ruff style)
- Fixed `async def` being misclassified as CALL instead of DEFINITION
  - This was causing blank lines to be incorrectly added between `async def` and its docstring
  - Now properly recognizes `async def` as a function definition
- Fixed class docstrings always requiring 1 blank line before first method, regardless of `after_docstring` config
  - Class docstrings now always get 1 blank line (PEP 257 requirement)
  - Function/method docstrings respect the `after_docstring` configuration setting
  - Fixed comment handling in blank line calculation to properly use BlockType.COMMENT

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-14

- Added configurable blank lines after docstrings via `after_docstring` configuration
  - Default: 1 blank line (PEP 257 compliance)
  - Set to 0 for compact style with no blank line after docstrings
  - Configurable via TOML (`after_docstring = 0`) or CLI (`--blank-lines-after-docstring 0`)
- Fixed module-level config imports to use JIT (just-in-time) imports for runtime configuration changes

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-05

**BREAKING CHANGES**: Full PEP 8 and PEP 257 compliance

- **PEP 8 Definition Spacing**: Scope-aware blank lines between function/class definitions
  - **2 blank lines** between top-level (module level) function/class definitions
  - **1 blank line** between method definitions inside classes (nested levels)
  - Automatically detects indentation level to apply correct spacing

- **PEP 257 Docstring Spacing**: Blank lines after docstrings follow normal block transition rules
  - Blank line required after docstrings before first statement (per PEP 257)
