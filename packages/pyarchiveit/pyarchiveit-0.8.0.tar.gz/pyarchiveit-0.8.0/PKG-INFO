# 📦 Pyarchiveit

[Pyarchiveit](https://pypi.org/project/pyarchiveit/) is a Python library designed to interact with the Internet Archive's Archive-it API. It provides a simple interface to manage the seeds and collections within Archive-it accounts.

## ✨ Features
- Create and update seeds with metadata validation
- Retrieve seed lists with their metadata for single or multiple collections
- Export seed data to CSV and XLSX formats

## 📥 Installation
You can install the library using pip:
```bash
pip install pyarchiveit
```
Or use [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if you have it installed:
```bash
uv add pyarchiveit
```

> [! TIP]
> As a best practice (and since the project is under active development), you should pin the version of `pyarchiveit` when installing it, e.g. `pip install pyarchiveit==0.1.0` or `uv add pyarchiveit==0.1.0`, to avoid unexpected issues from future updates.
