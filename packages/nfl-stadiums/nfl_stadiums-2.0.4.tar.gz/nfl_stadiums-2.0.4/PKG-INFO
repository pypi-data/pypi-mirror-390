## Installation
```bash
pip install nfl-stadiums
```

## Quick Start

```python
from nfl_stadiums import NFLStadiums

# Initialize with default settings (uses cache)
stadiums = NFLStadiums()

# Get all stadium names
stadium_list = stadiums.get_list_of_stadium_names()

# Get data for a specific team
lions_data = stadiums.get_stadium_by_team("lions")

# Get weather forecast for a game
weather = stadiums.get_weather_forecast_for_stadium('lions', '2024-12-15')
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Stadium Operations

```python
from nfl_stadiums import NFLStadiums

# Initialize the client
stad = NFLStadiums()

# Get a list of all stadium names
stadiums = stad.get_list_of_stadium_names()

# Get stadium data by team name
lions_stadium_data = stad.get_stadium_by_team("lions")

# Get stadium data by stadium name
stadium_data = stad.get_stadium_by_name("ford field")
```

### Coordinates and Distance

```python
# Get coordinates for a stadium
coords = stad.get_stadium_coordinates_by_team("lions")
coords = stad.get_stadium_coordinates_by_name("ford field")

# Calculate distance between two stadiums
miles = stad.calculate_distance_between_stadiums("lions", "rams")
```

### Weather Forecasting

```python
# Get weather forecast for a specific date
forecast = stad.get_weather_forecast_for_stadium('lions', '2024-05-30')

# Customize forecast parameters
forecast = stad.get_weather_forecast_for_stadium(
    "rams", 
    "2025/02/24", 
    hour_start=9, 
    hour_end=15, 
    day_format="%Y/%m/%d"
)
```

### Configuration Options

```python
# Force fresh data retrieval (bypass cache)
stad = NFLStadiums(use_cache=False)

# Disable verbose output
stad = NFLStadiums(verbose=False)

# Combine options
stad = NFLStadiums(use_cache=False, verbose=False)
```

## Data Examples

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Internet connection for data retrieval
- Dependencies are automatically installed with the package

## Data Sources

This package utilizes reliable, up-to-date data sources to provide accurate information:

### Caching and Data Responsibility

Stadium data is relatively static, so by default, this package saves data retrieved from Wikipedia locally for 
subsequent uses. This provides:
- **Faster access** on repeated requests
- **Reduced load** on Wikipedia servers
- **Offline capability** once data is cached

You are responsible for how you access and use the data in accordance with the terms of service of the underlying APIs.

### Wikipedia Data

Stadium information is sourced from the 
[List of current NFL stadiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_NFL_stadiums) Wikipedia page. 

**License**: Wikipedia content is licensed under the

### Weather Data (Open-Meteo)

Weather forecasting is powered by the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/), which provides:
- High-quality weather data
- Global coverage
- Free access for non-commercial use

**Terms**: Please review [Open-Meteo's Terms of Service](https://open-meteo.com/en/terms) for usage guidelines.
