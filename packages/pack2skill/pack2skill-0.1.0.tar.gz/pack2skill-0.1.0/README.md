A comprehensive system for capturing workflows and automatically generating Claude Skills from recorded user interactions.

## Overview

This pipeline transforms real-world workflows into Claude Skills through four progressive phases:

1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Recording & Basic Skill Generation
2. **Phase 2**: Improving Skill Quality (confidence, descriptions, robustness)
3. **Phase 3**: Collaboration & Deployment (team features)
4. **Phase 4**: Ecosystem Integration and Marketplace

## Features

- **Workflow Recording**: Capture screen video and user interaction events
- **Vision-Language Analysis**: Extract meaningful steps from video frames
- **Automated Skill Generation**: Create Claude Skills with proper structure and metadata
- **Confidence Scoring**: Rate the reliability of each generated step
- **Team Collaboration**: Version control, sharing, and deployment features
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Connect with Claude's skill marketplace and MCP plugins

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Record a workflow
python -m pack2skill record --output my_workflow.json

# Generate a skill
python -m pack2skill generate my_workflow.json --output ./skills/

# Install the skill
python -m pack2skill install ./skills/my-skill/
```
