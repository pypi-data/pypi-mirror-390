FUCCI cell cycle analysis plugin.
Obtain cell cycle information from FUCCI fluorescence intensities.

## Installation

The best way to run fucciphase is to install it in a virtual conda environment.
Make sure that git is installed and can be called from the command line.

To install from pip:

```bash
pip install fucciphase
```

If you wish to install it from source:
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Synthetic-Physiology-Lab/fucciphase
cd fucciphase
pip install -e .
```

The installation should not take longer than a few seconds (depending on your internet connection).

To use the notebooks, also install jupyter:
    
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

## Usage

Fucci phase currently supports loading a 
[TrackMate](https://imagej.net/plugins/trackmate/) XML file:

```python
from fucciphase import process_trackmate
from fucciphase.sensor import get_fuccisa_default_sensor

trackmate_xml = "path/to/trackmate.xml"
channel1 = "MEAN_INTENSITY_CH3"
channel2 = "MEAN_INTENSITY_CH4"

sensor = get_fuccisa_default_sensor()

df = process_trackmate(trackmate_xml,
                       channels=[channel1, channel2],
		       sensor=sensor,
                       thresholds=[0.1, 0.1])
print(df)
```

The TrackMate XML is converted to a [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame.
Thus, in general data (e.g., stored in a CSV or XLSX file) that can be parsed into
a DataFrame is supported.

Have a look at the examples in the `example` folder to get more information!

The runtime of the scripts depends on your datasize. 2D samples with a few hundred to a few thousand cells
can be processed in a few minutes. Visualization in Napari can take a bit longer.
Standard processing does not require a powerful computer.
Make sure that you have sufficient RAM to load videos for visualization in Napari.

## Development

To develop fucciphase, clone the repository, install fucciphase in your environment
and install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Synthetic-Physiology-Lab/fucciphase
cd fucciphase
pip install -e ".[test, dev]"
pre-commit install
```

If you want to build the documentation, replace the abovementioned pip install by:
```bash
pip install -e ".[test, dev, doc]"
```
