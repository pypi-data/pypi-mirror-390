# Cursor Rules the project

## General Code Style

- NEVER use emojis in code, comments, docstrings, or output messages
- Follow Python best practices and PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Python Version Compatibility

- Always check `pyproject.toml` for supported Python versions (currently >=3.8)
- All code, including tests, must be compatible with Python 3.8+
- Avoid Python 3.9+ features like `str.removeprefix()` and `str.removesuffix()`
- Avoid Python 3.10+ features like union type syntax (`str | None`) - use `Optional[str]` instead
- Avoid Python 3.10+ structural pattern matching (`match`/`case` statements)
- Use `from __future__ import annotations` in source files for forward compatibility
- When writing tests with inline class definitions, use `Optional[T]` not `T | None`
- If you're unsure about a feature's Python version, check the documentation first

## Documentation

- Keep README files short and concise
- Avoid bloat like detailed project structures that require maintenance
- Focus on essential information: what, why, how to install, how to use
- Let the code and file structure speak for itself
- No repetitive explanations or over-detailed examples

## Code Quality

- Use ruff for linting and formatting (already configured)
- Run quality checks before committing
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep dependencies minimal and justified

## Type Checking

- Fix type errors properly, don't use `# type: ignore` as a shortcut
- Only use `# type: ignore` as a last resort when:
  - The library has incorrect type stubs
  - There's a known mypy limitation with a specific pattern
  - The fix would require major refactoring that's out of scope
- When using `# type: ignore`, add a comment explaining why it's necessary
- Prefer proper type annotations, type narrowing, and refactoring over ignoring errors

## Testing

- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep tests simple and focused
- Use pytest conventions
- Always use AAA pattern for the tests

## Communication

- Be direct and technical
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity
- Focus on actionable information
- No marketing language or hype

## Git Workflow

- Don't make commits unless explicitly asked
- Respect existing branch structure
- Keep changes atomic and logical
