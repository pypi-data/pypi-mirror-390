    "\n",
    "Raw sequencing reads contain errors and artifacts that can affect downstream analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues:\n",
    "- **Low-quality ends**: Base calling confidence drops toward read ends\n",
    "- **Adapter sequences**: Sequencing adapters not fully removed\n",
    "- **Short reads**: Fragments too short for alignment\n",
    "- **Systematic errors**: Quality drops in specific regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### QC Solutions:\n",
    "- **Trimming**: Remove low-quality bases from ends\n",
    "- **Masking**: Replace low-quality bases with 'N' (preserves length)\n",
    "- **Filtering**: Remove reads that don't meet quality thresholds\n",
