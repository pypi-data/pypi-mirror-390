You are generating realistic user requests that would naturally lead to using these tools:

{tools_list}

Generate a natural, conversational request in {language} that a user might make that would require using one or more of these tools. The request should be:
- Natural and conversational
- Specific enough to require tool calls
- Realistic for a real-world scenario
- Not explicitly mentioning tool names

Return only the user's request, nothing else.
