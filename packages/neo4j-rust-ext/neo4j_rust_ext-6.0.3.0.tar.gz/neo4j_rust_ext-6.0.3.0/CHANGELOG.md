## [6.0.0.0a1](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/tree/6.0.0.0a1) (2025-07-29)
***
### **⭐️ New Features**
* Add extension for the `Vector` type ([#45]).
  * Speed up endian conversion (byte flipping).
  * Speed up conversion from and to native python types.
* Target driver version 6.0.0a1 ([#47]).

[#45]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/45
[#47]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/47

### **👏️ Improvements**
* Update dependencies ([#32]):  
  * ⚠️ Bump minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) from `1.67` to `1.77`.
  * Security fix by bumping PyO3 (Rust binding for Python) from `0.22.4` to `0.24.2`.
  * Update `maturin` (Python package builder) from `~= 1.6.0` to `~= 1.8.3`.
* Harden `Structure` class against memory leak ([#50]).  
  The extensions' implementation of packstream `Structure` could leak memory when being part of a reference cycle.
  In reality this doesn't matter because the driver never constructs cyclic `Structure`s.
  Every packstream value is a tree in terms of references (both directions: packing and unpacking).  
  This change is meant to harden the extensions against introducing effective memory leaks in the driver should the driver's usage of `Structure` change in the future.
* Optimize packing of `bytearray` ([#51]).
  By special-casing `bytearray`, we can avoid an allocation and complete extra copy of the data when packing it.
  This speeds up packing of `bytearray`s by roughly 1/3.

[#50]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/50
[#51]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/51

### **🧹️ Clean-up**
* ⚠️ Drop support for Python 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 ([#37]).

[#37]: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext/pull/37

### **📦️ Packaging**
* Update licensing meta data to be PEP 639 compliant ([#38]).
  * Update `maturin` (Python package builder) from `~= 1.8.3` to `~= 1.9.0`.
* ⚠️ Change licensing from "Apache-2.0" to "Apache-2.0 AND MIT"  ([#40]).
* Update dependencies ([#46]).
  * `PyO3`: `0.24.2` -> `0.25.1`
  * `maturin`: `1.9.0` -> `1.9.1`
