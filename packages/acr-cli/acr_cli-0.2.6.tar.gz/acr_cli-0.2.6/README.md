# ACR - Authomated Code Review

ACR is a utility for automatic static analysis of Python code with git integration (hooks), a set of rules and custom configuration.

## What does ACR do?

- Analyzes Python files (static rules: PEP8 styles, unused imports/variables, magic numbers, type mismatches, bare except, docstrings, etc.).

- Can be launched manually (acr review current, acr review staged, acr review file, acr review directory) and automatically via git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push).

- Supports custom rules, path filters and output modes (text, rich, json).

## Installation

ACR can be installed using pip:

```pip install acr-cli```

## Quick Start

Analysis of current changes:

```acr review current```

Analysis of only staged files (what will end up in the commit):

```acr review staged --output json```

Single file analysis.

```acr review file /path/to/file.py```

Directory analysis (the utility will automatically find python files).

```acr review directory /path/to/directory```

## Git hooks - what is installed and how it works

The utility can install pre-commit/pre-push hooks in the directory you specify (default is repo/.git/hooks).  

Сommands for working with hooks:

- ```acr install init-hooks-path --repo /path/to/repo```  
Creates a folder in the repository (hooks/ by default) and calls ```git config core.hooksPath hooks```

This switches git so that it looks for hooks not in .git/hooks, but in the specified folder inside the repository.  This is useful if you want to version hooks (so that you can see them in the repo and synchronize them with clones).

**IMPORTANT: if you have already installed hooks in .git/hooks, init_hooks_path will not move them automatically - you need to manually place/copy the scripts into hooks/ and commit.**

- ```acr install hook pre-commit -r /path/to/repo```  
Installs a pre-commit hook in repo/.git/hooks (or in hooks/ when core.hooksPath is pre-configured).

### What exactly is written to the hook?

Hook is a shell script (usually POSIX sh). It runs a command like:

```shell
acr review staged --output json [--strict]
rc=$?
if [ $rc -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ ACR pre-commit: staged checks failed (exit code $rc). Fix issues and re-stage."
  exit $rc
fi
```

- ```acr install hook pre-push -r /path/to/repo```  
Installs a pre-push hook in repo/.git/hooks (or in hooks/ when core.hooksPath is pre-configured).

- ```acr install hook_all -r /path/to/repo```  
Installs both pre-commit and pre-push hooks at once.

- ```acr install uninstall pre-commit -r /path/to/repo```  
Removes the pre-commit hook from repo/.git/hooks (or from hooks/ when core.hooks.Path is pre-configured).

- ```acr install uninstall pre-push -r /path/to/repo```  
Removes the pre-push hook from repo/.git/hooks (or from hooks/ when core.hooks.Path is pre-configured).

- ```acr install uninstall all -r /path/to/repo```  
Removes the both hooks from repo/.git/hooks (or from hooks/ when core.hooks.Path is pre-configured).

- ```acr install list -r /path/to/repo```  
Getting a list of hooks in the repository and indicating whether they were created using ACR or not.

## Flags for commands: their types and purpose

### For _review_ commands, all flags are the same:

- `--config (-c)` - path where the .acr.yaml configuration file is located (more on this below).
- `--output (-o)` - result output format (plain text, text with rich markup, json) (default: rich).
- `--strict (-s)` - indication of strict mode: in case of errors at the **WARNING** level, the check will end with exit code 1.
- `--severity (-S)` - indicating the minimum severity level for errors to be displayed (info, warning, error, critical) (default: info).  

For example: if the Severity Error level is specified, then errors with the Severity Error and Critical levels will be displayed.

### For _install_ commands:

#### hook/hook_all:

- `--repo (-r)` - path to git repository.
- `--force (-f)` - if True: if you try to create a hook with a type that is already in repo/.git/hooks (or from hooks/ when core.hooks.Path is pre-configured), then ACR will delete the existing one and create a new one (default: False).
- `--python` - python executable to embed in the hook (default: current interpreter).
- `--hook-strict` - if True: will run a command in the hook with the --strict flag (default: False).

#### uninstall:

- `--repo (-r)` - path to git repository.
- `--restore-backup` - if True: Restore .acr.bak backup if present (default: True).

#### list:

- `--repo (-r)` - path to git repository.

#### init-hooks-path:

- `--repo (-r)` - path to git repository.
- `--dir` - the name of the directory where the hooks will be located (default: hooks).

## Configuration

When running, ACR uses default settings.  

But if you need to change the Severity Level of any of the errors, or disable checking for any errors altogether, you can do this by adding .acr.yaml to the root directory of the repository.

ACR will automatically find the configuration file, but if for some reason this does not happen, specify the file location using the **--config (-c)** flag when running the command.

(Send bug reports, suggestions, etc. to me by email, which is listed at the very bottom).

Here is the complete configuration file with all possible settings:

```yaml
# -----------------------
# Global settings
# -----------------------

ignore_patterns:             # Glob patterns to ignore specific files (but not whole directories)
  - "venv/**"
  - "**/*.pyc"
  - "**/migrations/**"
  - "tests/fixtures/**"

exclude_paths:               # Paths (or globs) to completely exclude from analysis (directories)
  - "vendor"
  - "third_party"
  - "build"

# -----------------------
# Rules
# Each rule: enabled, severity, parameters (rule-specific)
# Severity: info | warning | error | critical
# -----------------------
rules:

  pep8:
    enabled: true   # will it check for this error or not
    severity: info  # severity level
    parameters:
      line_mode: "strip_indent"  # pep8 (default) | strip_indent (the latter skips leading spaces)
      max_line_length: 100        # override local PEP8 line length
      max_blank_lines: 5         # max blank lines between top-level definitions

  magic_number:
    enabled: true
    severity: info
    parameters:
      ignored_numbers: [0, 1, -1, 100, 1000]  # numbers to never treat as magic

  long_function:
    enabled: true
    severity: warning
    parameters:
      max_lines: 50           # maximum allowed lines in a function before it's considered "long"

  high_complexity:
    enabled: true
    severity: warning
    parameters:
      max_complexity: 10      # cyclomatic complexity threshold

  unused_import:
    enabled: true
    severity: warning
    parameters:
      ignore_modules:   # imports that will not be considered unused
        - "__future__"
        - "typing"
```
