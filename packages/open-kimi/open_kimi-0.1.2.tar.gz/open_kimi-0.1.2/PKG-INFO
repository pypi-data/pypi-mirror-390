# Open-Kimi-K2-Thinking

![Architecture kimi k2](image/arch.png)

This repository is a straightforward attempt to implement the base Kimi K2 Reasoning model architecture in pure PyTorch as simply as possible.

[Link](https://huggingface.co/moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Thinking)

## Install

```bash
pip3 install -U open-kimi
```

## Example

```python
from open_kimi.model import KimiK2
import torch

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = KimiK2(
        dim=512,
        depth=2,
        attention_heads=8,
        experts=16,
        experts_per_token=4,
        seq_len=1024,
        lite_verison=True,
        vocab_size=10000,
    )

    x = torch.randint(0, 10000, (2, 1024))
    out = model(x)
    print(out)
```

## Full Example

```python
from open_kimi.model import KimiK2
import torch

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = KimiK2(
        dim=7168,
        depth=61,
        attention_heads=64,
        experts=384,
        experts_per_token=8,
        seq_len=1024,
        lite_verison=False,
        vocab_size=160000,
    )

    x = torch.randint(0, 10000, (2, 7168))
    out = model(x)
    print(out)
```

## Kimi Linear

![Kimi Linear Architecture](image/linear.png)

Kimi Linear is a hybrid linear attention architecture that outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios, including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning scaling regimes. At its core is **Kimi Delta Attention (KDA)**, an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited finite-state RNN memory. **Paper Link**: [Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture](https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.26692) (arXiv:2510.26692)

### Usage Example

```python
import torch
from open_kimi.kimi_linear import KimiLinear

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = KimiLinear(
        dim=512,
        num_heads=8,
        head_dim=64,
        chunk_size=64,
        n_experts=16,
        n_activated=4,
        kda_layers=2,
        depth=2,
        vocab_size=10000,
        seq_len=1024,
    )

    x = torch.randint(0, 10000, (2, 1024))
    out = model(x)
    print(out)
    print(out.shape)
```

## Post Training

On the model huggingface page, they mention they use Native INT4 Quantization in the post training phase. So I would say a good post training recipe would include:

- Native INT4 Quantization
- MUON Optimizer
- GRPO
