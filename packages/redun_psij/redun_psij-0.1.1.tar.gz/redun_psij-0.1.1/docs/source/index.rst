redun_psij
==========

``redun_psij`` enables `redun <https://insitro.github.io/redun/index.html>`_
tasks to be scheduled on any job scheduler supported by `PSI/J <https://exaworks.org/psij>`_, which includes Slurm, PBS, LFS among others.

It is not tightly integrated into redun, and therefore has a different flavour than the executors natively supported in redun.
