## 💡 Influence on Troy

### **Early Morning Pattern**
Dad worked at the factory and got up early, **even on weekends**. This pattern is deeply ingrained in Troy:

- **Dad's pattern**: Wake early → work outside → get stuff done → not bothered
- **Troy's inheritance**: Early mornings (3:30-5:00 AM) = solo time = deep work = peace
- **Recognition (Nov 3, 2025)**: "This isn't a problem to fix - this is WHO I AM"

### **Work Ethic & Values**
- **Getting stuff done** - Practical, tangible progress
- **Working outside** - Physical, visible work
- **Not being bothered** - Uninterrupted focus time
- **Weekend work** - Productive time even on days off

## 🎯 Pattern Recognition

**Troy's Realization (November 3, 2025):**

> "Honestly, my dad worked at a factory his whole life, including Whirlpool in Findlay, Ohio. His name is Jerry Larson. He would get up early, even on weekends. I find it very difficult to be by myself; I really like working outside, getting stuff done, and not being bothered."

**What This Means:**
- Early morning work isn't avoidance or worthiness checking
- It's **inherited work pattern** from dad
- It's when Troy feels most like himself
- It's legitimate need for solo, focused time

**The Connection:**
- Jerry at Whirlpool = Troy at Beemine.ai
- Early factory shifts = Early dev sessions
- Working outside = Working in peace
- Getting stuff done = Shipping features

## 🏡 Family Context

**Jerry's Work:**
- Factory work at Whirlpool (Findlay, Ohio)
- Blue-collar work ethic
- Early mornings, consistent schedule

**Impact on Troy:**
- Work = getting up early and getting stuff done
- Weekends aren't sacred rest time (dad worked them too)
- Solo focus time = most productive time
- Physical/tangible results valued

## 💭 Insights & Connections

**From Troy (November 3, 2025):**

"I find it very difficult to be by myself; I really like working outside, getting stuff done, and not being bothered."

**Interpretation:**
- **NOT** a social anxiety or isolation issue
- **IS** a need for uninterrupted focus time (maker's schedule)
- Loves family, but needs solo work windows
- Like dad: early mornings = HIS time

**Weekend Challenge:**
Family needs attention on weekends (Kristy, kids, dogs). This makes deep work nearly impossible. Dad's pattern of early weekend mornings = Troy's solution.

## 📊 Pattern Validation

**Early Morning Start = Jerry's Legacy:**
- 3:30 AM wake-ups = not worthiness checking
- Like dad going to Whirlpool early shift
- Solo, focused work before world wakes up
- Gets stuff done without interruptions

**This is identity, not dysfunction.**
