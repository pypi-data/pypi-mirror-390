## 👨‍🎓 Profile

**Relationship:** Troy's stepson (Kristy's son)  
**School:** University of Georgia (UGA) → Georgia Tech (accepted!)  
**Program:** Engineering (Georgia Tech)  
**Academic Performance:** Straight-A student

---

## 📚 Current Situation (November 2025)

### **Georgia Tech Transition**
- ✅ **Accepted to Georgia Tech** engineering program (major accomplishment!)
- ⚠️ **Athens sublease issue**: Needs to find sublease taker OR take over existing sublease
- 💰 **Financial pressure**: $8,000 at stake if not handled properly
- 📍 **Location**: Currently at UGA in Athens, GA

---

## 🎭 Personality & Patterns

### **Owen's Style:**
- **Academically brilliant** - Straight-A student
- **Disorganized** - Opposite of Kristy's hyper-organized style
- **Smart but scattered** - Can handle engineering coursework but not life logistics

### **The Contrast:**
| Owen | Kristy (Mom) |
|------|--------------|
| Disorganized | Hyper-organized planner |
| Reactive | Proactive |
| Scattered | Meticulous |
| Last-minute | Plans ahead |

## 💔 Impact on Kristy (Mom)

### **Kristy's Stress Pattern:**

**The Challenge:**
> "She loves him, but she gets overwhelmed because she feels she has to step in and plan everything for him. It's very stressful."

**What Happens:**
1. Owen doesn't handle logistics (sublease, planning, etc.)
2. Kristy sees potential disaster ($8K loss)
3. Kristy feels she MUST step in and fix it
4. Kristy becomes stressed and anxious
5. Kristy processes stress out loud (interruptions)
6. Troy gets interrupted constantly

**The Pattern:**
- **Owen's disorganization** → **Kristy's anxiety** → **Troy's interrupted work**
- Kristy feels responsible for managing Owen's life
- Can't let go even though Owen is 19 and capable
- Helicopter parenting stress despite Owen being adult

---

## 💡 The Real Dynamic

**Troy's Insight (November 3, 2025):**

> "My wife, on the other hand, is incredibly organized and a meticulous planner, while Owen is the opposite, which can be very frustrating for her. She loves him, but she gets overwhelmed because she feels she has to step in and plan everything for him."

**What This Means:**
- Owen is **capable** (straight-A Georgia Tech engineering student!)
- Owen is **disorganized** with life logistics
- Kristy **can't let go** and let Owen learn/fail
- Kristy's stress = Troy's problem (via interruptions)

---

## 🚨 Current Crisis (November 2025)

### **$8K Sublease Situation**

**The Problem:**
- Owen transitioning from UGA → Georgia Tech
- Has Athens apartment that needs sublease
- Two options:
  1. Find someone to take over sublease
  2. Take over the sublease himself
- If neither happens: **$8,000 cost**

**Why It's Stressing Kristy:**
- Financial stakes are high
- Owen not handling it proactively
- Deadline approaching (presumably?)
- Kristy feels she must fix it

**Impact on Troy (Sunday, Nov 2):**
- Kristy processing stress = constant interruptions
- Can't focus on Beemine.ai launch
- Every 20 minutes: another interruption
- Maker's schedule completely destroyed

---

## 🎯 Pattern Recognition

### **This Is a Recurring Dynamic:**
1. **Owen faces life logistics challenge** (apartment, finances, planning)
2. **Owen doesn't handle it proactively** (disorganized style)
3. **Kristy sees disaster coming** (her organized mind sees all risks)
4. **Kristy feels she MUST intervene** (can't let him fail/learn)
5. **Kristy becomes stressed and anxious** (processing burden)
6. **Troy gets interrupted constantly** (Kristy needs to talk it through)
7. **Troy can't do deep work** (especially on weekends)

### **The Core Issue:**
- **NOT Owen's fault** - He's 19, capable, learning
- **NOT Kristy's fault** - She loves her son and sees real risks
- **IS a pattern** - Kristy taking responsibility for Owen's life challenges
- **IMPACTS Troy** - Via constant interruptions on weekends

## 💭 Troy's Perspective

**From November 3, 2025:**

"I love my family, and my wife and I have a great relationship, but yesterday was really tough. She interrupted me a lot, which made it hard to start anything. I was constantly interrupted by her and the dogs, and it turned into a crazy day."

**Translation:**
- Troy loves Kristy (great relationship!)
- Troy loves Owen (not blaming him!)
- **The PATTERN is the problem** - constant interruptions
- Especially hard on weekends when trying to do deep work
- Not about not wanting to help - about needing uninterrupted focus time
