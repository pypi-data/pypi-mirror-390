## 💭 Morning Brain Dump

**What's on my mind right now:**
- Doug Loud's IISIAssistant doc loader issue - need to fix the 400 errors and file loading problems
- Tax meeting with Zana (TurboTax CPA) at 10:15 AM - she's super helpful and will be my new tax CPA


**What's working well:**
- Mike Ryan loved the jump box script yesterday - major win!
- Doug is making progress independently and is patient with delays
- Zana (TurboTax CPA) was super helpful with 2024 taxes
- Made progress on Jira MCP server at Freddie Mac


**What needs attention:**
- IISIAssistant doc loader 400 errors (same ID/API key work in regular workflow but not doc loader)
- File loading issue - only loads newest file, not subsequent ones
- Need to ensure it can process all documents in "Rag Docs" regardless of creation date
- Tax meeting with Zana at 10:15 AM - need to be prepared for 2024 tax review
