# Underpromise and Overdeliver

**Source**: Mike Ryan feedback  
**Context**: Professional development  
**Importance**: Critical for career growth  

## The Statement

"Underpromise and overdeliver"

## Context

Mike Ryan (boss's boss) provided this feedback after the AWS CLI project completion. He noted that I tend to overpromise on timelines and deliverables, which can lead to:
- Late deliveries
- Disappointed clients
- Damaged professional relationships
- Increased stress and pressure

## Application

### Timeline Management
- Add 25-50% buffer time to all estimates
- Promise conservative deadlines, then deliver early
- Communicate early if there are any delays

### Scope Management
- Promise minimum viable deliverables
- Exceed expectations with additional value
- Set realistic expectations from the start

### Communication
- Set expectations low, then surprise with quality
- Be honest about capabilities and limitations
- Focus on quality over speed

## Benefits

- Builds trust and credibility
- Reduces stress and pressure
- Creates positive surprises
- Strengthens professional relationships
- Improves work-life balance

## Notes

*Add specific examples and applications of this principle*
