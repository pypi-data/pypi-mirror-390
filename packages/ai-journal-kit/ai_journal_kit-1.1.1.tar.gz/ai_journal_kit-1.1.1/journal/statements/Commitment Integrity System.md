# Commitment Integrity System

**Core Principle**: Honor every commitment made - no ghosting, no broken promises

## The Problem

- **Pattern**: Making promises → Getting overwhelmed → Ghosting clients
- **Impact**: Damaged relationships, lost trust, professional reputation risk
- **Root Cause**: Overcommitting without realistic time assessment

## Current Active Commitments

### **IMMEDIATE (This Week)**
1. **Doug Loud** - "I have time tomorrow" (Sep 12) - IISIAssistant + subdomain help
2. **Jeff Mehl** - Chat simulator by Tuesday (Sep 16) - PROMISED DEADLINE
3. **Kristen Cillo** - Backend training session next week (not Monday)

### **THIS WEEKEND**
4. **Freddie Mac** - Tavily + FredAI setup (2-3 hours) before Monday

### **ONGOING**
5. **Jeff & Kristen** - Daily feedback loop during chat simulator testing

## The System

### **Before Making Any Commitment:**
1. **Time Assessment**: How long will this actually take?
2. **Buffer Time**: Add 50% to initial estimate
3. **Current Load Check**: What else is already committed?
4. **Energy Check**: Do I have the mental/physical capacity?

### **When Making Commitments:**
1. **Be Specific**: Exact date/time, not "soon" or "this week"
2. **Underpromise**: Set conservative expectations
3. **Document Immediately**: Add to commitment tracker
4. **Set Reminders**: Calendar alerts, phone reminders

### **Daily Commitment Check:**
1. **Morning Review**: What commitments are due today?
2. **Progress Check**: Am I on track for upcoming commitments?
3. **Communication**: If behind, communicate early (not when late)

### **When Overwhelmed:**
1. **Stop Making New Commitments** - No new promises until current ones are met
2. **Communicate Early** - "I need to adjust the timeline" vs. ghosting
3. **Offer Alternatives** - "I can do X instead of Y" or "I can do this part now, rest later"

## Commitment Tracker Template

```
## Active Commitments
- [ ] **Person**: Task - Due Date - Status
- [ ] **Doug Loud**: IISIAssistant help - Sep 12 - In Progress
- [ ] **Jeff Mehl**: Chat simulator - Sep 16 - In Progress
- [ ] **Kristen Cillo**: Backend training - Week of Sep 15 - Pending

## Completed This Week
- [x] **Mike Ryan**: AWS CLI credential refresh - Sep 10 - Completed
- [x] **Jeff Mehl**: Response to concerns email - Sep 11 - Completed

## Communication Log
- **Sep 11**: Told Doug "I have time tomorrow" - MUST FOLLOW THROUGH
- **Sep 11**: Promised Jeff chat simulator by Tuesday - CRITICAL DEADLINE
```

## Red Flags (Stop Making Commitments When:)
- Already have 3+ active commitments
- Feeling overwhelmed or stressed
- Behind on existing commitments
- Haven't communicated status updates in 48+ hours

## Recovery Protocol (When Behind)
1. **Immediate Communication**: "I need to adjust the timeline"
2. **New Realistic Date**: Based on actual capacity, not wishful thinking
3. **Partial Delivery**: "I can do X now, Y by [new date]"
4. **Overdeliver on New Promise**: Make sure the new commitment is met

## Success Metrics
- **Zero ghosting incidents** per month
- **All commitments met** on or before promised date
- **Early communication** when timelines need adjustment
- **Client satisfaction** with reliability and communication

**Remember**: Your word is your bond. Every broken promise damages trust. Every kept promise builds it.
