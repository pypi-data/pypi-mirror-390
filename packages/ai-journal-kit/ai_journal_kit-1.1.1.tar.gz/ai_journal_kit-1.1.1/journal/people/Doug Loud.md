## Recent Progress (Sep 9-11, 2025)

### **Tuesday, Sep 9:**
- **9:46 AM**: Asked about your 2 hour 45 min concentration session
- **3:49 PM**: XImport Documents issue - PROD AI Magician Bulk Doc Loader crashes
- **9:48 PM**: "YAY! 🎉 I asked Gemini what was wrong... IT WROTE A FILE INTO QDRANT!!! YAY! 🎉"
- **10:26 PM**: "You have trained me well !!! Thank you!!"

### **Wednesday, Sep 10:**
- **8:38 PM**: Your response: "Yay!"
- **8:46 PM**: "Yes! Now to get it to work for IISIAssistant, and then to do multiples. And any clues you have on getting iisisoftr.inegratedinformation.net to work as a subdomain would be hugely valuable. All I have is an A @ 35.158.87.123 record suggestion. SO, ArchMage of Atlanta are you OK?"

### **Thursday, Sep 11:**
- **7:16 PM**: "Sorry to say I've reached my limit - spent hours trying to get the IISIAssistant doc loader to work but can't - ridiculous! I really need some simple help. The regular iiassistant workflow works fine, but using the same id and api key gets endless 400 errors in all possible permutations."
- **7:17 PM**: Your response: "I have time tomorrow -- I'm taking the time off"

### **Saturday, Sep 13:**
- **11:30 AM**: Asked for full summary of current status, workflow details, error locations
- **11:31 AM**: "Not using lovable for this and everything is in DO and n8n"
- **11:32 AM**: "A zoom might solve many issues quickly - should be home by 12:00"
- **12:09 PM**: "Finally back at the ranch"
- **2:16 PM**: Your response: "I'm working on it now -- give me a while. I'm going to duplicate and update so it doesn't break what you have."
- **2:18 PM**: Doug: "😎"
- **4:50 PM**: Your response: "WORKING ON IT! I PROMISE!" (with screenshot)
- **5:17 PM**: Doug: "😎 I know you are! but you'll see that things that should work, dont for mysterious reasons - wait until you hear all the things I've tried. And one astonishing quasi solution."
