## 🚫 YouTube Replacement Strategy

### **The Problem:**
Default to mindless YouTube watching instead of intentional learning from paid memberships.

### **The Solution:**

**When I Feel Like Watching YouTube:**
1. **PAUSE** - Notice the urge
2. **CHECK THIS HUB** - What valuable content am I missing?
3. **CHOOSE** - Pick one priority item from memberships
4. **ENGAGE** - Watch/attend with intention
5. **APPLY** - Note one thing to implement

**Accountability:**
- Track YouTube time vs. Membership content time
- Goal: Shift 80% of "learning" time to memberships
- Use Rize to track patterns

---

## 📈 Monthly Review

### **Last Month's Stats**
- **Memberships Engaged:** X of Y
- **Live Events Attended:** X
- **Recorded Content Watched:** X
- **Applied Learnings:** X
- **Total Investment:** $X

### **Questions to Ask Monthly:**

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Tip 1: Quality Over Quantity**
Don't try to attend everything. Pick 2-3 high-value items per week and actually APPLY them.

**Tip 2: Batch Content**
Set specific "content days" (e.g., Tuesday/Thursday evenings) for membership engagement.

**Tip 3: Take Action Notes**
For every piece of content, write ONE thing to implement. Learning without application is entertainment.

**Tip 4: Engage, Don't Just Consume**
Ask questions in community. Share wins. Network. Passive watching = YouTube. Active engagement = growth.

**Tip 5: Review ROI**
If you haven't engaged with a membership in 2 months, cancel it. Don't pay for guilt.
