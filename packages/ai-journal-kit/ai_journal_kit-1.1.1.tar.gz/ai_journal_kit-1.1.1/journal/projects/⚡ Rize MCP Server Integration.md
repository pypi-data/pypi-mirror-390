# ⚡ Rize MCP Server Integration

> [!info] **Project Overview**
> Building an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to integrate Rize time tracking with AI coach. This will enable real-time time analysis, productivity insights, and automatic calendar management based on actual time tracking data.

> [!success] **🎉 NOW ACTIVE & INTEGRATED (Oct 19, 2025)**
> **Zero Manual Overhead** - Rize MCP Server is now integrated with AI coach!
> - ✅ Automatic time tracking (passive data collection)
> - ✅ No extra work required from Troy
> - ✅ AI can analyze time patterns automatically
> - ✅ Supports breakthrough work (passion vs. panic analysis)

## 🎯 Project Purpose

**Why This Matters:**
- Get AI-powered analysis of how I'm actually spending my time
- Automatically add time tracking to calendar
- Understand patterns of productive vs. distracted time
- Integrate with existing productivity system (Beeminder, ClickUp, daily check-ins)

**The Vision:**
- Real-time conversation about time usage
- "How did I spend my time today?" gets actual data
- AI can suggest improvements based on actual patterns
- Seamless integration with daily command center workflow

## 🔧 Technical Components

### **Rize Integration**
- **What is Rize:** Advanced automatic time tracker
- **Features Used:**
  - Automatic tracking of apps, websites, tasks
  - Focus time detection
  - Productivity scoring
  - Break notifications
  - Overworking alerts
- **API Access:** Need to research Rize API capabilities

### **MCP Server Development**
- **Technology:** MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Purpose:** Create bridge between Rize data and AI conversations
- **Capabilities:**
  - Query time tracking data
  - Analyze productivity patterns
  - Add events to calendar based on tracked time
  - Export data for analysis

### **AI Coach Integration**
- **Goal:** Have AI coach access Rize data in real-time
- **Use Cases:**
  - "How much time did I spend on Daybreak today?"
  - "What were my top distractions this week?"
  - "Add my actual work time to my calendar"
  - "Am I working from passion or panic today?"

## 💡 Project Notes

**Why Saturday October 18?**
This is part of the weekend practice - working on something I'm EXCITED about (passion), not something I MUST do (panic).

**Connection to Breakthrough:**
This tool helps me understand: Am I working from passion or panic? The data will show the patterns.

**Sustainability:**
Building this because it's genuinely useful for my productivity system, not because I "should" be working this weekend.
