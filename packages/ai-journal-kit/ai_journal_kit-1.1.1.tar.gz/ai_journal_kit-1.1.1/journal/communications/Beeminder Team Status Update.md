Hey team! 👋

**Current Status:**
✅ **Dev environment** is almost fully deployed to AWS  
✅ **Infrastructure** is terraformed and ready  
✅ **Core functionality** is working in dev  

**What's Left:**
- Finish testing the dev deployment (almost there!)

- Send beta user email notifications

**Timeline:**
Still on track for **Friday launch** - just need to wrap up the dev testing and push to production.

**The Good News:**
The hard infrastructure work is done. It's now just validation and deployment. Should be smooth sailing from here! 🚀

I'll keep you posted as we get closer to Friday!
