> [!tip] **Remember**: Troy, the struggle is real—journaling CAN feel repetitive when you're in the thick of it. But here's the truth: **consistency beats complexity**. You don't need to fill out every section every day. Just show up, capture what matters, and keep moving forward. You've got this! 💪
