    for sale, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions
    or its ContributorVersion.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
distributes such Contribution.

2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted
under this License:

(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
    or

(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your modifications of Covered
    Software, or (ii) the combination of Covered Software with other
    software or devices.

2.4. Fair Use

This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
equivalents.

2.5. Conditions

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including
modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form, You must also
make the Source Code Form of the Covered Software available, as described
in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
how they can obtain a copy of the Source Code Form.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Coveraction of Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such
Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that
the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further
distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
or such Secondary License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it clear that any such
warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
-------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the
Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
-------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You come into
compliance, then the rights granted under this License from a
particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and
until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
and (b) permanently, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come into compliance. Moreover, Your grants under this License from a
particular Contributor are reinstated permanently if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You come into compliance prior to 30 days
after Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of
this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
rights granted to You under this License shall terminate. Sections 1,
2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.4, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will survive any
termination of this License.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of
any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any
Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this
disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
or anyone else who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be
liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if
such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
place of business or, if the defendant is an individual, where the
defendant resides, and each party consents to the jurisdiction of such
courts, provided that nothing herein shall prevent either party from
bringing an action to enforce a judgment or order of such courts in
any other jurisdiction.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

10. Versions of the License
---------------------------

10.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
distinguishing version number.

10.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
or under the terms of anyC-version of the License published by the
license steward.

10.3. Modified Versions

If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
the modified license differs from this License).

10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses

If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
Secondary Licenses, You may not include a notice described in Exhibit B
in Your distribution. If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that
is compatible with Secondary Licenses, You may include a notice
described in Exhibit B in Your distribution, and You may simultaneously
distribute the Covered Software under a Secondary License, as described
in Section 3.3.
