## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Using Pre-built Executable (Recommended)

1. Download `BEBE_Task_Recorder.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/me-suzy/BEBE-Task-Recorder/releases) page
2. Run the executable (it will automatically request administrator privileges)
3. Start recording!

### Option 2: Running from Source

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/me-suzy/BEBE-Task-Recorder.git
   cd BEBE-Task-Recorder
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python bebe_gui.py
   ```
   
   **Note**: On Windows, run with administrator privileges for global event capture:
   ```bash
   # Right-click PowerShell/CMD and select "Run as Administrator", then:
   python bebe_gui.py
   ```
   
   Or use the provided batch script:
   ```bash
   RUN_GUI.bat
   ```

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start Recording**:
   - Click "Start Inregistrare"
   - Perform your actions (mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input)
   - Press `ESC` or `F9` to stop recording

2. **Review Events**:
   - View all recorded events in the "Evenimente (optimizate cu context)" table
   - Check timestamps and event details

3. **Save Task**:
   - Click "Salveaza task"
   - Enter a descriptive name
   - Task is saved in the `tasks/` folder

4. **Load Task**:
   - Select from dropdown list, or
   - Click "Incarca din fisier..." to browse
   - Click "Incarca task selectat" to load

5. **Playback**:
   - Click "Start Redare"
   - Watch your recorded actions replay automatically

### Recording Tips

- **Position Matters**: The recorder captures absolute screen coordinates. If you move windows or icons before playback, positions may not match. This is expected behavior for precise automation.

- **Key Combinations**: All standard Windows shortcuts work:
  - `Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V` (Select All, Copy, Paste)
  - `Alt+Tab` (Switch windows)
  - `Alt+F4` (Close window)
  - `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` (Task Manager)
  - And more...

- **Stop Recording**: Press `ESC` or `F9` at any time to stop recording

## 🔨 Building Executable

To create a standalone `.exe` file with automatic administrator privileges:

1. **Install build dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_build.txt
   ```

2. **Run build script**:
   ```bash
   BUILD.bat
   ```

3. **Find executable**:
   - Output: `dist/BEBE_Task_Recorder.exe`
   - The executable automatically requests admin privileges on launch

### Build Requirements

- `pyinstaller` - For creating executables
- `pyautogui`, `pynput` - Runtime dependencies

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture

- **GUI Framework**: Tkinter (native Python GUI)
- **Event Capture**: `pynput` library for global mouse/keyboard hooks
- **Automation**: `pyautogui` for precise mouse/keyboard control
- **Storage**: JSON format for task files
- **Threading**: Separate threads for recording/playback to keep GUI responsive

### Key Features Implementation

- **Key Combination Detection**: Properly handles control characters (e.g., `\x01` = Ctrl+A)
- **Modifier Tracking**: Maintains state of Ctrl/Alt/Shift keys during recording
- **Event Serialization**: Efficient JSON storage with timestamps
- **Admin Privileges**: Windows UAC manifest embedded in executable

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Administrator Privileges

**Why admin rights are needed**: Global keyboard and mouse hooks require elevated privileges on Windows. Without admin rights, the application can only capture events from its own window.

**Security**: The application only requests admin rights for event capture. It does not modify system files or settings.

### Position-Based Recording

**Important**: BEBE records **absolute screen coordinates**. This means:
- ✅ Perfect for fixed workflows (same window positions)
- ⚠️ If you move windows/icons before playback, coordinates won't match
- 💡 **Tip**: Keep your desktop layout consistent, or use relative positioning for future versions

This is intentional design for precise automation - similar to professional macro tools.
