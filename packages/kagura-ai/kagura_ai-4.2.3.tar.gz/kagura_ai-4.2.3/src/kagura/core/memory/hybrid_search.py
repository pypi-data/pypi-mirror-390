"""Hybrid search combining vector and lexical search with RRF fusion.

Implements Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to combine results from:
- Vector search (semantic similarity)
- Lexical search (keyword matching)

Based on "Reciprocal Rank Fusion outperforms Condorcet and individual Rank
Learning Methods" (Cormack et al., SIGIR 2009).

Example:
    >>> from kagura.core.memory.hybrid_search import rrf_fusion
    >>> vector_results = [
    ...     {"id": "doc1", "score": 0.9, "rank": 1},
    ...     {"id": "doc2", "score": 0.7, "rank": 2},
    ... ]
    >>> lexical_results = [
    ...     {"id": "doc2", "score": 5.2, "rank": 1},
    ...     {"id": "doc3", "score": 3.1, "rank": 2},
    ... ]
    >>> fused = rrf_fusion(vector_results, lexical_results, k=60)

    where:
    - d is a document
    - s is a search system (vector or lexical)
    - rank_s(d) is the rank of document d in system s
    - k is a constant (typically 60)

        - k=60 is the standard value from the original RRF paper
        - Lower k gives more weight to top-ranked documents
        - Higher k gives more uniform weighting across ranks
