# bt1337xearch

Better search for 1337x[.]to with basic filters

## What it does

bt1337xearch is a command-line tool that searches 1337x.to torrents with:
- Category filtering (Movies, TV, Games, etc.)
- Sorting options (by time, size, seeders, leechers)
- Keyword filtering (include/exclude keywords)

## Installation
```bash
uv tool install bt1337xearch
```
or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SimoneFelici/bt1337xearch.git
cd bt1337xearch
uv tool install .
```

## Usage

### Basic search (Probably broken)
```bash
bt1337xearch -n "Dexter"
```

### Search with category (Recommended)
```bash
bt1337xearch -n "Lupin" -c ANIME
```

### Search with sorting
```bash
bt1337xearch -n "Alien" -c MOVIE -s TIME -o DESC
```

### Advanced filtering
Use `+` to include words and `~` to exclude words:
```bash
# Include only results with "1080p" or "BluRay"
bt1337xearch -n "Dexter" -f +1080p +BluRay

# Exclude results with "CAM" or "TS"
bt1337xearch -n "Movie" -f ~CAM ~TS

# Combine include and exclude
bt1337xearch -n "Dexter" -c TV -f +1080p "~x265 HEVC" ~CAM
```

## Options

| Option | Description | Choices |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-n, --name` | Name of the media (required) | - |
| `-c, --category` | Filter by category | MOVIE, TV, GAME, MUSIC, APP, DOCU, ANIME, OTHER, XXX |
