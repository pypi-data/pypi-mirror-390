# cjnfuncs - A framework and collection of utility functions for script writing

## cjnfuncs is comprised of several modules (follow links to respective documentation)

NOTE:  Since relative links to other .md files do not work on PyPI, please go to the [cjnfuncs GitHub repo](https://github.com/cjnaz/cjnfuncs) to read the documentation. 

module | Description/Purpose
--|--
[core](core.md)                   | Set up the base environment
[configman](configman.md)         | Feature-rich configuration file toolset
[timevalue](timevalue.md)         | Handle time values with units, such as '5m' (5 minutes), and schedule future operations
[mungePath](mungePath.md)         | Ease-of-use pathlib extension for constructing and manipulating file paths
[rwt / run_with_timeout](rwt.md)  | Execute any function with an enforced timeout
[deployfiles](deployfiles.md)     | Push bundled setup files within a package to the proper user/system locations
[resourcelock](resourcelock.md)   | Inter-process resource lock mechanism
[SMTP](SMTP.md)                   | Send notification and email messages

Developed and tested on Python 3.9.21 and supported on all higher Python versions.
Developed on Linux.  Supported on Windows, except for the resourcelock module (posix-ipc module dependency).

In this documentation, "tool script" refers to a Python project that imports and uses cjnfuncs. Some may be simple scripts, and others may themselves be installed packages.

## Installation and usage

```
pip install cjnfuncs
```

A package template using cjnfuncs is available at https://github.com/cjnaz/tool_template, which 
is the basis of PyPI posted tools such as:
  - [lanmonitor](https://pypi.org/project/lanmonitor/)
  - [wanstatus](https://pypi.org/project/wanstatus/)
  - [routermonitor](https://pypi.org/project/routermonitor/)

## Key changes since the prior major public release (version 3.0)

- Several issues with Windows support were fixed.

- `configman.config_item()` now supports a safe_mode switch, which will speed up Windows usage of loadconfig() at some risk.  See the note on `config_item()`.

- Named child loggers are now implemented on several cjnfuncs modules.  By default, logging from cjnfuncs modules is disabled (logging events are usually at the INFO or DEBUG
level, while the default logging level is set to WARNING).  For example, logging from configman may be enabled by `logging.getLogger('cjnfuncs.configman').setLevel(logging.INFO)`,
or using `core.set_logging.level(logging.INFO, 'cjnfuncs.configman')`.

- Changed mungePath set_attributes from default True to default False to avoid long processing time on Windows by default.

- deployfiles can now create an empty target directory.
