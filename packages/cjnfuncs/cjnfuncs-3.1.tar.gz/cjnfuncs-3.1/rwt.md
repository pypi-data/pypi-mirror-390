# rwt / run_with_timeout - run any function with an enforced timeout

Skip to [API documentation](#links)

Some built-in, standard library, installed packages, and user-written functions can hang awaiting a response from
an intermittent resource.  EG, attempting to check the existence of a file on a network drive when the server hosting
the file is non-responsive.  

`run_with_timeout()` provides a method to execute any function with an enforced timeout.

To run any function using `run_with_timeout()`, simply change the call structure to pass the function
pointer as the first argument to `run_with_timeout()`, then specify the timeout limit using the additional `rwt_timeout` 
keyword argument.

## Works well on Linux, but serious constraints on Windows

Usage on Windows can be challenging due to the nature of Windows.

- Windows implements multiprocessing by spawning a entire new Python interpreter.  This takes at least a second on a fast computer.  This startup time must be added to the rwt_timeout arg, as compare to the same call on Linux.

- Because of using spawn, the function to be run must be defined at the top-level of the module, not defined within nested code.  This function, and the global information of the module are pickled and sent to the new Python interpreter process.  The spawned process executes the pickled code at startup, and then the called top-level function.  For this reason, the main code must be guarded inside `if __name__ == '__main__':` or you end up with a recursive loop.

- Variables can only be accessed by the spawned process if they were globally and statically defined in the main module, so no dynamic state info can be passed thru globals.  Similarly, work done by the spawned process cannot be made available to the main process thru globals (this is the same on Linux).  Passing info between the calling main process and the spawned process should be via function args and returned values.

- The root logger handler used by the main process (eg, configured by setuplogging()) is only erratically available to the spawned process.

- Linux uses fork to launch a new multiprocess, which avoids all of these Windows problems.

Bottom line:  If you need a controlled timeout for a function on Windows then keep it simple.  run_with_timeout() is functional on Windows, with coding constraints and with a substantial startup time penalty.  See [https://github.com/cjnaz/cjnfuncs/blob/main/tests/demo-rwt.py](https://github.com/cjnaz/cjnfuncs/blob/main/tests/demo-rwt.py) for example tests/usage that run on Windows and Linux.

## Basic example

Given:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ***** rwt_ex1.py *****

import time
from cjnfuncs.rwt import run_with_timeout

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Case 1
    print ("0.5 sec delay")
    run_with_timeout (time.sleep, 0.5, rwt_timeout=1)

    # Case 2
    print ("0.5 sec delay, killed after 0.2 sec")
    run_with_timeout (time.sleep, 0.5, rwt_timeout=0.2)
```

The output:
```
$ ./rwt_ex1.py 
0.5 sec delay
0.5 sec delay, killed after 0.2 sec
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/share/dev/packages/cjnfuncs/tools/doc_code_examples/./rwt_ex1.py", line 14, in <module>
    run_with_timeout (time.sleep, 0.5, rwt_timeout=0.2)
  File "/mnt/share/dev/packages/cjnfuncs/src/cjnfuncs/rwt.py", line 152, in run_with_timeout
    raise TimeoutError (f"Function <{func.__name__}> timed out after {_timeout} seconds (killed)")
TimeoutError: Function <sleep> timed out after 0.2 seconds (killed)
```

What's going on?  Of note:
- The standard library time.sleep() function is being called in both cases.  Note that `time.sleep` has no parens since
we're passing the _callable_ to `run_with_timeout()`, not actually calling it directly.
- In Case 2, we set `rwt_timeout` to less than the sleep time, causing `run_with_timeout()` to terminate the sleep early and raise
a `TimeoutError` exception.  In real usage the exception should be trapped and handled.

Notables:
1. Logging to the console with timestamps is used in this example to show the enforced timeout in Test 3.
2. A function executed by run_with_timeout has read/write access to a _copy_ of the vars, functions, classes, etc that are available in the main thread.
3. A direct call to my_func is executed in the main thread, and changes to global variables are applied.
4. When calling my_func with run_with_timeout, leave off the `()` off of the `my_func` reference, and include my_func's args and keyword args exactly as with a direct call to my_func.  Add run_with_timeout's keyword args, as needed.  The default rwt_timeout value is 1.0 sec.
5. Since run_with_timeout gets a _copy_ of the global vars, the change made within my_func is not applied to the main thread's globals.
6. All calls to run_with_timeout should handle the possible TimeoutError exception.  Note that there is an addition 10ms delay in the process
termination handling for rwt debug logging.

## Using rwt_kill=False and manually killing orphaned processes

This example creates three orphaned processes who's pids are returned in the timeout exception raised by
run_with_timeout.  The code extracts the pids and kills the processes.

Code:
```
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# ***** rwt_ex3.py *****

import time
import os
import signal

from cjnfuncs.core      import set_toolname, logging
from cjnfuncs.rwt       import run_with_timeout

set_toolname('rwt_ex3')


def wont_terminate():
    # This function is hard to kill.  SIGTERM doesn't break the loop.
    while 1:
        try:
            time.sleep (0.2)
        except:
            pass


try:
    run_with_timeout(wont_terminate, rwt_timeout=0.5, rwt_kill=False, rwt_ntries=3)
except Exception as e:
    logging.error (f"EXCEPTION received:  {type(e).__name__}: {e}")

    # Kill the orphaned processes
    orphaned_pids = str(e).split('orphaned pids: ')[1].split(' ')
    for pid in orphaned_pids:
        os.kill(int(pid), signal.SIGKILL)
```

Output from the exception log:
```
rwt_ex3.<module>             -    ERROR:  EXCEPTION received:  TimeoutError: Function <wont_terminate> timed out after 0.5 seconds (not killed) orphaned pids: 2069926 2069931 2069969
```

## Controlling logging from within rwt code

Logging within the rwt module uses the `cjnfuncs.rwt` named/child logger.  By default this logger is set to the `logging.WARNING` level, 
meaning that no logging messages are produced from within the rwt code.  For validation and debug purposes, logging from within rwt code 
can be enabled by setting the logging level for this module's logger from within the tool script code:

        logging.getLogger('cjnfuncs.rwt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

        # Or alternately, use the core module set_logging_level() function:
        set_logging_level (logging.DEBUG, 'cjnfuncs.rwt')

# run_with_timeout (func, *args, **kwargs, rwt_timeout=1.0, rwt_ntries=1, rwt_kill=True) - Run a function in a separate process with an enforced timeout.

`run_with_timeout` uses the multiprocessing module, and works by running the specified `func` in a managed 
external process that can be reliably killed on timeout.
For a non-timeout run, `run_with_timeout` returns what the `func` returns or any exception raised. 
On timeout, the process is killed (by default) and a TimeoutError exception is raised.


### Args

`func` (callable)
- The function to run
- May be any function - built-in, standard library, supplied by an installed package, or user-written
- On Windows `func` must be defined as a top level function of the module

`*args` (0+)
- Positional args required by func

`**kwargs` (0+)
- Keyword args to be passed to func

`rwt_timeout` additional kwarg (int or float, default 1.0)
- Enforced timeout in seconds

`rwt_ntries` additional kwarg (int, default 1)
- Number of attempts to run `func` if rwt_timeout is exceeded or `func` raises an exception

`rwt_kill` additional kwarg (bool, default True)
- If True, on timeout kill the process
- If False, on timeout let the process continue to run.  It will be orphaned - see Behavior notes, below.


### Returns
- With no timeout or exception, returns the value returned from `func`
- Any exception raised by `func`
- If rwt_timeout is exceeded, returns TimeoutError
- Exceptions raised for invalid rwt_timeout, rwt_ntries, or rwt_kill values


### Behaviors and rules
- Logging within the called `func` is done at the logging level in effect when run_with_timeout is called. 
`logging.getLogger('cjnfuncs.rwt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)` enables additional status and trace info, intended for debug and regression testing.
- If making a subprocess call and the subprocess timeout limit is triggered, a
subprocess.TimeoutExpired exception is produce with an odd error message on Python 3.11.9: 
`TypeError: TimeoutExpired.__init__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'timeout'`. Generally, don't use
the subprocess timeout arg when using run_with_timeout.
- If `rwt_kill=False` then the forked/spawned process will not be killed, and if the process doesn't exit by itself 
then the tool script will hang on exit, waiting for the orphan process to terminate.
To solve this the tool script needs to kill any orphaned processes created by run_with_timeout before exiting. 
The pids of the orphaned processes are listed in the TimeoutError exception when `rwt_kill=False`, and can
be captured for explicitly killing of any unterminated orphaned processes before exiting the tool script, eg: 
`os.kill (pid, signal.OSKILL)`.  See `rwt.md` for a working example.
Note that if `rwt_ntries` is greater than 1 and `rwt_kill=False`, then potentially several processes may 
be created and orphaned, all attempting to doing the same work.
- On Windows, debug logging messages from the run_with_timeout internal `worker()` function (which calls `func`) are 
erratically produced, and not produced if `func` raises an exception.  Logging from within `func` can also be
erratic.  Raised exceptions operate normally.
