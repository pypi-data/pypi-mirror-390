# numeth

A fully functional Python package implementing core numerical methods for engineering and applied mathematics. Designed for usability and educational clarity.

## Installation

Install via pip:

```
pip install numeth
```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example using the Newton-Raphson method to find the square root of 2:

```python
from numeth import newton_raphson

def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2

def df(x):
    return 2 * x

root, iterations, converged = newton_raphson(f, df, x0=1.0, tol=1e-6, max_iter=100)
print(f"Root: {root}, Iterations: {iterations}, Converged: {converged}")
# Output: Root: 1.414213562373095, Iterations: 4, Converged: True
```
