This package is a fork of [pyflowchart](https://github.com/cdfmlr/pyflowchart),
originally developed by CDFMLR and licensed under the MIT License.

This fork extends the functionality to generate react-flow compatible workflow definitions.

# PyReactFlow

PyReactFlow is a Python package that lets you create react-flow compatible workflow definitions from Python code.

## Get PyFlowchart

```sh
$ pip install pyreactflow
```

## Sample nodes/edges generation
Update the code blob in `example.py` and run `python example.py`

## Testing
Whenever there is a change in nodes or export method, run `pytest test_export.py` to ensure that the change still works well with existing logics.
