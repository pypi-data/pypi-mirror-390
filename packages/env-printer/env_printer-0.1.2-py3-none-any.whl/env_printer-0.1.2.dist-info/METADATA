## env-printer

A tiny Python package that prints all environment variables and recursively lists all files starting at a specified root (default: `/`). It attempts to do this automatically right after installation and also provides a CLI to trigger it manually.

### Important notes about post-install behavior
- Modern Python packaging installs pre-built wheels, which typically do not execute arbitrary code at install time. This package wires a custom `install` command that runs after a legacy `setup.py install`. Depending on how the installer resolves your environment, the post-install may run during the build step rather than the final install step, or it may be skipped entirely when installing a wheel.
- To force running the legacy installation flow locally, you can install from source with:

```bash
pip install --no-binary :all: --no-use-pep517 env-printer
```

Even if the post-install hook does not execute, you can still run the same behavior manually via the CLI (below).

### CLI usage
After installing, you can run:

```bash
env-printer-run
```

Options:
- `--root <path>`: change the starting directory for file listing (default: `/`).

### What it does
1. Prints all environment variables as `KEY=VALUE`.
2. Recursively lists all files under the chosen root (default: `/`), skipping unreadable paths and not following symlinks.

### Install locally from this repository

```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
pip install dist/env-printer-*.whl
```

To exercise the legacy flow and run the post-install hook:

```bash
pip install --no-binary :all: --no-use-pep517 .
```
