## PTELASTIC

Security testing tool for identifying, fingerprinting, and exploiting vulnerabilities in Elasticsearch instances.  
The tool:
- Identifies whether or not Elasticsearch is running on a host
- Identifies whether it is running on HTTP or HTTPS
- Identifies whether or not it has authentication enabled
- Enumerates:
   - Elasticsearch version
   - Modules, their version and description
   - Installed plugins and their version
   - Users, their roles and privileges
- Tests for the following CVEs:
   - CVE-2015-5531
   - CVE-2015-1427
   - CVE-2014-3120
   - CVE-2015-3337
   - any other CVE the host might be vulnerable to
- Dumps:
   - Structure of indices
   - Data from indices

## Installation

```
pip install ptelastic
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Usage examples

ptelastic -u https://www.example.com/
```
