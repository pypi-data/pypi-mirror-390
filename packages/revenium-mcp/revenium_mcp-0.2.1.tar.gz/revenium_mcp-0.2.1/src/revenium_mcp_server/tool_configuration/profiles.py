Defines the tool sets for each profile tier optimized for AI analytics and usage-based billing.

Profile Structure:
- Starter (7 tools): Essential cost monitoring and alerting
- Business (15 tools): Complete AI analytics and usage-based billing capabilities (default)

Note: Enterprise profile removed as it was redundant after infrastructure monitoring tools removal.
Note: revenium_log_analysis consolidated into system_diagnostics (2025-11-06)
