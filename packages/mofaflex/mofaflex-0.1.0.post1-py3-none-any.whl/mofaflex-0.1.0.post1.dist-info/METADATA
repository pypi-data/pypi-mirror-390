![graphical abstract](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioFAM/mofaflex/main/docs/_static/img/mofaflex_schematic.svg)

MOFA-FLEX is a versatile factor analysis framework designed to streamline the construction and training of complex matrix factorisation models for omics data.
It is built on a probabilistic programming-based Bayesian factor analysis framework that integrates concepts from multiple existing methods while remaining modular and extensible.
MOFA-FLEX generalises widely used matrix factorisation tools by incorporating flexible prior options (including structured sparsity priors for multi-omics data and covariate-informed priors for spatio-temporal data), non-negativity constraints, and diverse data likelihoods - allowing users to mix and match components to suit their specific needs.
Additionally, MOFA-FLEX introduces a novel module for integrating prior biological knowledge in the form of gene sets or, more generally, variable sets, enabling the inference of interpretable latent factors linked to specific molecular programs.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [documentation][]. In particular, the

- [Getting started guide][getting started].
- [Tutorials][].
- [API documentation][].

## Installation

You need to have Python 3.11 or newer installed on your system. If you don't have
Python installed, we recommend installing [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html).

There are several alternative options to install MOFA-FLEX:

1. Install the latest release of MOFA-FLEX from [PyPI][]:

```bash
pip install mofaflex
```

2. Install the latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/bioFAM/mofaflex.git@main
```

## Release notes

See the [changelog][].

## Contact

For questions and help requests, you can reach out in the [discussions][].
If you found a bug, please use the [issue tracker][].
