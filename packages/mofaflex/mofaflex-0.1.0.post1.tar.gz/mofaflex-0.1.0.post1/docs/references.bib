We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex�vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

Moreover, MEFISTO can integrate multiple related datasets by simultaneously identifying and aligning the underlying patterns of variation in a data-driven manner. To illustrate MEFISTO, we apply the model to different datasets with spatial or temporal resolution, including an evolutionary atlas of organ development, a longitudinal microbiome study, a single-cell multi-omics atlas of mouse gastrulation and spatially resolved transcriptomics.},

In genomic medicine, for instance, patients can be characterized by data from different molecular layers. Latent variable models with structured sparsity are a commonly used tool for disentangling variation within and across data views. However, their interpretability is cumbersome since it requires a direct inspection and interpretation of each factor from domain experts. Here, we propose MuVI, a novel multi-view latent variable model based on a modified horseshoe prior for modeling structured sparsity. This facilitates the incorporation of limited and noisy domain knowledge, thereby allowing for an analysis of multi-view data in an inherently explainable manner. We demonstrate that our model (i) outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for modeling structured sparsity in terms of the reconstruction error and the precision/recall, (ii) robustly integrates noisy domain expertise in the form of feature sets, (iii) promotes the identifiability of factors and (iv) infers interpretable and biologically meaningful axes of variation in a real-world multi-view dataset of cancer patients.},

Here, we present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model based on transformed Gaussian processes that naturally encourages sparsity and scales to tens of thousands of observations. NSF recovers ground truth factors more accurately than real-valued alternatives such as MEFISTO in simulations, and has lower out-of-sample prediction error than probabilistic NMF on three spatial transcriptomics datasets from mouse brain and liver. Since not all patterns of gene expression have spatial correlations, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features.

	abstract = { of the core problems of modern statistics is to approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online. },

Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution.  We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations.  We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods.

	abstract = {  Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a powerful modeling tool, able
to represent any computable probability distribution. Unfortunately,
probabilistic program inference is often intractable, and existing PPLs mostly
rely on expensive, approximate sampling-based methods. To alleviate this
problem, one could try to learn from past inferences, so that future inferences
run faster. This strategy is known as amortized inference; it has recently been
applied to Bayesian networks and deep generative models. This paper proposes a
system for amortized inference in PPLs. In our system, amortization comes in
the form of a parameterized guide program. Guide programs have similar
structure to the original program, but can have richer data flow, including
neural network components. These networks can be optimized so that the guide
approximately samples from the posterior distribution defined by the original
program. We present a flexible interface for defining guide programs and a
stochastic gradient-based scheme for optimizing guide parameters, as well as
some preliminary results on automatically deriving guide programs. We explore
in detail the common machine learning pattern in which a 'local' model is
specified by 'global' random values and used to generate independent observed
data points; this gives rise to amortized local inference supporting global
model learning.

modes for an appropriate choice of prior distribution. Bayesian shrinkage
methods, particularly the horseshoe estimator, have recently attracted a great
deal of attention in the problem of estimating sparse, high-dimensional linear
models. This paper extends these ideas, and presents a Bayesian grouped model
with continuous global-local shrinkage priors to handle complex group
hierarchies that include overlapping and multilevel group structures. As the
posterior mean is never a sparse estimate of the linear model coefficients, we
extend the recently proposed decoupled shrinkage and selection (DSS) technique
to the problem of selecting groups of variables from posterior samples. To
choose a final, sparse model, we also adapt generalised information criteria
approaches to the DSS framework. To ensure that sparse groups, in which only a
few predictors are active, can be effectively identified, we provide an
alternative degrees of freedom estimator for sparse Bayesian linear models that
takes into account the effects of shrinkage on the model coefficients.
Simulations and real data analysis using our proposed method show promising
performance in terms of correct identification of active and inactive groups,
and prediction, in comparison with a Bayesian grouped slab-and-spike approach.

	abstract = {The horseshoe prior has proven to be a noteworthy alternative for sparse Bayesian estimation, but has previously suffered from two problems. First, there has been no systematic way of specifying a prior for the global shrinkage hyperparameter based on the prior information about the degree of sparsity in the parameter vector. Second, the horseshoe prior has the undesired property that there is no possibility of specifying separately information about sparsity and the amount of regularization for the largest coefficients, which can be problematic with weakly identified parameters, such as the logistic regression coefficients in the case of data separation. This paper proposes solutions to both of these problems. We introduce a concept of effective number of nonzero parameters, show an intuitive way of formulating the prior for the global hyperparameter based on the sparsity assumptions, and argue that the previous default choices are dubious based on their tendency to favor solutions with more unshrunk parameters than we typically expect a priori. Moreover, we introduce a generalization to the horseshoe prior, called the regularized horseshoe, that allows us to specify a minimum level of regularization to the largest values. We show that the new prior can be considered as the continuous counterpart of the spike-and-slab prior with a finite slab width, whereas the original horseshoe resembles the spike-and-slab with an infinitely wide slab. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real world data illustrate the benefit of both of these theoretical advances.},

While gene set testing methods have been widely used in supervised settings to quantify the association of groups of genes with clinical outcomes, these methods have seen only limited application for testing the enrichment of gene sets relative to sample PCs. We describe a novel approach, principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE), for unsupervised gene set testing relative to the sample PCs of genomic data. The PCGSE method computes the statistical association between gene sets and individual PCs using a two-stage competitive gene set test. To demonstrate the efficacy of the PCGSE method, we use simulated and real gene expression data to evaluate the performance of various gene set test statistics and significance tests. Gene set testing is an effective approach for interpreting the PCs of high-dimensional genomic data. As shown using both simulated and real datasets, the PCGSE method can generate biologically meaningful and computationally efficient results via a two-stage, competitive parametric test that correctly accounts for inter-gene correlation.},

	abstract = {Droplet single-cell RNA-sequencing (dscRNA-seq) has enabled rapid, massively parallel profiling of transcriptomes. However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of >99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-\ensuremath{\beta} and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.},

	abstract = {The paired measurement of RNA and surface proteins in single cells with cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) is a promising approach to connect transcriptional variation with cell phenotypes and functions. However, combining these paired views into a unified representation of cell state is made challenging by the unique technical characteristics of each measurement. Here we present Total Variational Inference (totalVI; https://scvi-tools.org ), a framework for end-to-end joint analysis of CITE-seq data that probabilistically represents the data as a composite of biological and technical factors, including protein background and batch effects. To evaluate totalVI's performance, we profiled immune cells from murine spleen and lymph nodes with CITE-seq, measuring over 100 surface proteins. We demonstrate that totalVI provides a cohesive solution for common analysis tasks such as dimensionality reduction, the integration of datasets with different measured proteins, estimation of correlations between molecules and differential expression testing.},
