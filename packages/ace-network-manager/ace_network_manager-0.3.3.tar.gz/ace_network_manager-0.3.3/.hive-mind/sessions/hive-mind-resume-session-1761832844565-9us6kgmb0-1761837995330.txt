🎯 Objective: The netplan tool included in ubuntu 20.04 and 24.04 has bugs that do not handle restoring routing tables or dhcp acquired settings after failing a try, let's investigate and plan a tool that would handle making changes to networks in deployed edge environments, it should have a timeout feature that would restore previously applied configs if not confirmed by a user, and it should also schedule a run on restart to restore if not confirmed, we can potentially use semaphore files to track the state of a change application, further it should keep all previous configurations as .bak files with the dates they were changed, we use python and uv for all of our tooling, ruff for linting, and pyrefly for type checking

🎯 RESUMPTION PROTOCOL:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. **RESTORE CONTEXT**:
   - Review all checkpoint data and activity history above
   - Use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage to retrieve collective memory
   - Check agent statuses and reassign tasks if needed
   - Verify all in-progress tasks are still valid

2. **CONTINUE EXECUTION**:
   - Resume in-progress tasks with their assigned agents
   - Process pending tasks based on priority (CRITICAL > HIGH > NORMAL > LOW)
   - Maintain agent coordination through memory sharing
   - Update progress tracking after each task completion

3. **COORDINATION REQUIREMENTS**:
   - Use mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage for all cross-agent communication
   - Apply consensus mechanisms for important decisions
   - Maintain swarm topology: unknown
   - Keep session checkpoint data updated regularly

4. **MEMORY CONTEXT**:
   - Session memory namespace: session-session-1761832844565-9us6kgmb0
   - Swarm memory namespace: swarm-swarm-1761832844565-mzf76z2my
   - Use these namespaces to access historical decisions and context

Resume the hive mind operation with full context awareness and continue working towards the objective.
