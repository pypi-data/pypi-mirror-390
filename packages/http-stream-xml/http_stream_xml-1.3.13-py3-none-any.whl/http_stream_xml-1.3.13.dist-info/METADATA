http-stream-xml
===============

|made_with_python| |build_status| |coverage| |pypi_version| |pypi_license| |readthedocs|

Parse XML from HTTP responses on the fly, chunk by chunk.

This works with `HTTP protocol chunks <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding>`_
or partial downloads of large HTTP responses.

I use it to work with the `NCBI (PubMed) Entrez API <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/>`_.

See usage examples in these blog articles:
* `XML streaming chunks load <https://sorokin.engineer/posts/en/xml_streaming_chunks_load.html>`_
* `Entrez gene streaming with http-stream-xml <https://sorokin.engineer/posts/en/entrez_gene_streaming_with_http_stream_xml.html>`_

Documentation
-------------
`Documentation <https://http-stream-xml.sorokin.engineer/>`_

Scripts
-------
Install `invoke <https://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/>`_ preferably with pipx:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipx install invoke

To get available scripts:

.. code-block:: bash
