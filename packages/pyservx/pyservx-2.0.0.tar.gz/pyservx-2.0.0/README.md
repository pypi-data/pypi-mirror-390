## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install pyservx

```bash
pipx install pyservx
```

Requires Python 3.6 or higher.

Run the server:

```bash
pyservx
```

Or with custom options:

```bash
pyservx --port 8080 --no-qr
```

- The server automatically creates a shared folder in your Downloads directory (`PyServeX-Shared`)
