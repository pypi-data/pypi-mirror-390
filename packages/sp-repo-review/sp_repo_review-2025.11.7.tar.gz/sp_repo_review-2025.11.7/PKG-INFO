`sp-repo-review` provides checks based on the [Scientific-Python Development
Guide][] at [scientific-python/cookie][] for [repo-review][].

This tool can check the style of a repository. Use like this:

```bash
uvx sp-repo-review[cli] <path to repository>
```

This will produce a list of results - green checkmarks mean this rule is
followed, red x’s mean the rule is not. A yellow warning sign means that the
check was skipped because a previous required check failed. Some checks will
fail, that’s okay - the goal is bring all possible issues to your attention, not
to force compliance with arbitrary checks. Eventually there might be a way to
mark checks as ignored.

For example, `GH101` expects all your action files to have a nice `name:` field.
If you are happy with the file-based names you see in CI, you should feel free
to simply ignore this check (you can specify ignored checks in pyproject.toml or
by passing args to repo-review, see the [repo-review
docs][repo-review configuring]).

All checks are mentioned at least in some way in the [Scientific-Python
Development Guide][]. You should read that first - if you are not attempting to
follow them, some of the checks might not work. For example, the guidelines
specify pytest configuration be placed in `pyproject.toml`. If you place it
somewhere else, then all the pytest checks will be skipped.

This was originally developed for [Scikit-HEP][] before moving to Scientific
Python.

## Extras

- `cli`: Dependencies to run the CLI (not needed for programmatic access, like
  on Web Assembly)
- `pyproject`: Include validate pyproject with schema store.
- `all`: All extras

## Helper utility

There's also a script, accessible as `sp-ruff-checks`, that will compare your
ruff checks to the known values. It's a little more elegant on the command line
than the Ruff family description, which will only print out a basic list.

## Other ways to use

You can also use GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- uses: scientific-python/cookie@<version>
```

Or pre-commit:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/scientific-python/cookie
  rev: <version>
  hooks:
    - id: sp-repo-review
```

If you use `additional_dependencies` to add more plugins, like
`validate-pyproject`, you should also include `"repo-review[cli]"` to ensure the
CLI requirements are included.
