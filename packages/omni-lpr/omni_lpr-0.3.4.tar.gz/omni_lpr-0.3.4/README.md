A multi-interface (REST and MCP) server for automatic license plate recognition

</div>

---

Omni-LPR is a self-hostable server that provides automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) capabilities via a REST API
and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It can be used both as a standalone ALPR microservice and as an ALPR toolbox for
AI agents and large language models (LLMs).

### Why Omni-LPR?

Using Omni-LPR can have the following benefits:

- **Decoupling.** Your main application can be in any programming language. It doesn't need to be tangled up with Python
  or specific ML dependencies because the server handles all of that.

- **Multiple Interfaces.** You aren't locked into one way of communicating. You can use a standard REST API from any
  app, or you can use MCP, which is designed for AI agent integration.

- **Ready-to-Deploy.** You don't have to build it from scratch. There are pre-built Docker images that are easy to
  deploy and start using immediately.

- **Hardware Acceleration.** The server is optimized for the hardware you have. It supports generic CPUs (ONNX), Intel
  CPUs (OpenVINO), and NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA).

- **Asynchronous I/O.** It's built on Starlette, which means it has high-performance, non-blocking I/O. It can handle
  many concurrent requests without getting bogged down.

- **Scalability.** Because it's a separate service, it can be scaled independently of your main application. If you
  suddenly need more ALPR power, you can scale Omni-LPR up without touching anything else.


See the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the list of implemented and planned features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Omni-LPR is in early development, so bugs and breaking API changes are expected.
> Please use the [issues page](https://github.com/habedi/omni-lpr/issues) to report bugs or request features.

### Quickstart

You can get started with Omni-LPR in a few minutes by following the steps described below.

#### 1. Install the Server

You can install Omni-LPR using `pip`:

```sh
pip install omni-lpr
```

#### 2. Start the Server

When installed, start the server with a single command:

```sh
omni-lpr
```

By default, the server will be listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
You can confirm it's running by accessing the health check endpoint:

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health
# Sample expected output: {"status": "ok", "version": "0.3.4"}
```

#### 3. Recognize a License Plate

Now you can make a request to recognize a license plate from an image.
The example below uses a publicly available image URL.

```sh
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "https://www.olavsplates.com/foto_n/n_cx11111.jpg"}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/tools/detect_and_recognize_plate_from_path/invoke
```

You should receive a JSON response with the detected license plate information.

### Usage

Omni-LPR exposes its capabilities as "tools" that can be called via a REST API or over the MCP.

#### Available Tools

The server provides tools for listing models, recognizing plates from image data, and recognizing plates from a path.

- `list_models`: Lists the available detector and OCR models.

- **Tools that process image data** (provided as Base64 or file upload):
    - `recognize_plate`: Recognizes text from a pre-cropped license plate image.
    - `detect_and_recognize_plate`: Detects and recognizes all license plates in a full image.

- **Tools that process an image path** (a URL or local file path):
    - `recognize_plate_from_path`: Recognizes text from a pre-cropped license plate image at a given path.
    - `detect_and_recognize_plate_from_path`: Detects and recognizes plates in a full image at a given path.

For more details on how to use the different tools and provide image data, please see the
[API Documentation](docs/README.md).

#### REST API

The REST API provides a standard way to interact with the server. All tool endpoints are available under the `/api/v1`
prefix. Once the server is running, you can access interactive API documentation in the Swagger UI
at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/apidoc/swagger.

#### MCP Interface

The server also exposes its tools over the MCP for integration with AI agents and LLMs. The MCP endpoint is available at
http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/, via streamable HTTP.

You can use a tool like [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) to explore the available MCP
tools.

### Integration

You can connect any client that supports the MCP protocol to the server.
The following examples show how to use the server with [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/).

#### LM Studio Configuration

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "omni-lpr-local": {
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp/"
        }
    }
}
```

The screenshot below shows using the `detect_and_recognize_plate_from_path` tool in LM Studio to detect and recognize
the license plate from an [image available on the web](https://www.olavsplates.com/foto_n/n_cx11111.jpg).
