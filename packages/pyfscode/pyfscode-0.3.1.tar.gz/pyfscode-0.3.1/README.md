> Turn your VS Code / Vim into a file operations IDE.
> Generate safe, reviewable batch scripts (move/rename/copy/delete, etc.) from a "visual manifest".

## 🏁 Quick Start

```bash
pip install PyFSCode
find ./photos -name "*.jpg" | fscode --editor='code -w' *.txt
```

## 🤔 Why This Tool?

Batch file operations (rename / move / delete) are the most common yet error-prone tasks in the command-line world:

- `mv`, `cp`, `rm` commands are very clumsy and error-prone for **batch** operations.
- Manually writing `for` loops and `sed` for renaming carries a heavy mental load.
- **Swapping filenames** is very complex and often impossible even in a GUI.

`fscode` provides a more powerful and unified solution.

## 🚀 What Can It Do?

`fscode` lets you use your editor to plan batch file operations and safely generate a script for execution.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🧭 **Editor as UI** — Use the powerful features of VS Code/Vim (multi-cursor, regex, macros) to manage files;
- 🧱 **Smart Dependency Handling** — Automatically resolves swap, cycle, and move conflicts;
- 🪶 **Safe and Controllable** — Does not modify files directly, only generates a reviewable file operation script;
- 💡 **Full Operation Support** — Supports creation, copying, moving, deleting, and renaming.
- **Custom Commands** - For example, you can replace `touch` with `ai-generate` to create files with content.
- **Custom Command Prefix** - For example, you can use `sudo` as a prefix for the output script.

# 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install PyFSCode
# Or using uv
uv tool install PyFSCode
```

# 🧑‍💻 Usage Example

## 💻 Step 1: Input Files from Command Line

⚠️ [NOTE]: If your `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` environment variable points to VS Code, please use `--editor='code -w'` to wait for the window to close before continuing.

### Method 1: Input from Pipe

```bash
find ./photos -name "*.jpg" | fscode
```

### Method 2: Pass as Arguments

```bash
fscode *.jpg *.txt
```

### Method 3: Pipe + Arguments

```bash
find ./photos -name "*.jpg" | fscode *.jpg *.txt
```

### Method 4: Use Custom Commands (Advanced Users)

```bash
fscode --is_exchange --editor='code -w' --create='new' --remove='del' --move='mov' *.jpg
```

## 📄 Step 2: Modify Filenames in the Editor

The editor will open a file similar to this:

```sh
# <ID> <Path>
1 photos/vacation.jpg
2 photos/birthday.jpg
3 project/notes.txt
4 "photos/old picture.jpg"
```

You just need to modify it:

```sh
# File Operation Plan
# ... (comments omitted) ...
#
# My Modifications

# 1. Rename (Edit the path)
1 photos/Paris_Vacation_2025.jpg

# 2. Move (Edit the path)
3 archive/old_notes.txt

# 3. Copy (Duplicate the line, use the same ID 2)
2 photos/birthday.jpg
2 photos/backup_birthday.jpg

# 4. Delete (Delete or comment out the line with ID 4)
# 4 "photos/old picture.jpg"

# 5. Create (Add a new line, ID is 0, quotes are needed due to spaces)
0 "new_project/new note.txt"
```

## ⚡ Step 3: Execute

After saving and closing the editor, FSCode will generate a script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
touch "new_project/new note.jpg"
cp photos/birthday.jpg photos/backup_birthday.jpg
mv photos/vacation.jpg photos/Paris_Vacation_2025.jpg
mv project/notes.txt archive/old_notes.txt
rm "photos/old picture.jpg"
```

After reviewing it for correctness, execute it:

```bash
source ./file_ops.sh
```

✅ All changes can be safely reviewed before execution.
