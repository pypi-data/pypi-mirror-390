# TextTools

## 📌 Overview

**TextTools** is a high-level **NLP toolkit** built on top of modern **LLMs**.  

It provides both **sync (`TheTool`)** and **async (`AsyncTheTool`)** APIs for maximum flexibility.

It provides ready-to-use utilities for **translation, question detection, keyword extraction, categorization, NER extraction, and more** — designed to help you integrate AI-powered text processing into your applications with minimal effort.

---

## ✨ Features

TextTools provides a rich collection of high-level NLP utilities built on top of LLMs.  
Each tool is designed to work with structured outputs (JSON / Pydantic).

- **`categorize()`** - Classifies text into Islamic studies categories 
- **`is_question()`** - Binary detection of whether input is a question
- **`extract_keywords()`** - Extracts keywords from text
- **`extract_entities()`** - Named Entity Recognition (NER) system
- **`summarize()`** - Text summarization
- **`text_to_question()`** - Generates questions from text
- **`merge_questions()`** - Merges multiple questions with different modes
- **`rewrite()`** - Rewrites text with different wording/meaning
- **`subject_to_question()`** - Generates questions about a specific subject
- **`translate()`** - Text translation between languages
- **`run_custom()`** - Allows users to define a custom tool with arbitrary BaseModel

## ⚙️ `with_analysis`, `logprobs`, `output_lang`, `user_prompt`, `temperature` and `validator` parameters

TextTools provides several optional flags to customize LLM behavior:

- **`with_analysis=True`** → Adds a reasoning step before generating the final output. Useful for debugging, improving prompts, or understanding model behavior.  
Note: This doubles token usage per call because it triggers an additional LLM request.

- **`logprobs=True`** → Returns token-level probabilities for the generated output. You can also specify `top_logprobs=<N>` to get the top N alternative tokens and their probabilities.  

- **`output_lang="en"`** → Forces the model to respond in a specific language. The model will ignore other instructions about language and respond strictly in the requested language.

- **`user_prompt="..."`** → Allows you to inject a custom instruction or prompt into the model alongside the main template. This gives you fine-grained control over how the model interprets or modifies the input text.

- **`temperature=0.0`** → Determines how creative the model should respond. Takes a float number from `0.0` to `1.0`.

- **`validator=validation_function`** → Forces TheTool to validate the output result based on your custom validator. Validator should return bool (True if there were no problem, False if the validation failed.) If validator failed, TheTool will retry to get another output by modifying `temperature`.

All these parameters can be used individually or together to tailor the behavior of any tool in **TextTools**.

**Note:** There might be some tools that don't support some of the parameters above.

## 🚀 Installation

Install the latest release via PyPI:

```bash
pip install -U hamtaa-texttools
```

## Sync vs Async
| Tool         | Style   | Use case                                    |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| `TheTool`    | Sync    | Simple scripts, sequential workflows        |
| `AsyncTheTool` | Async | High-throughput apps, APIs, concurrent tasks |

## ⚡ Quick Start (Sync)

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from texttools import TheTool

# Create your OpenAI client
client = OpenAI(base_url = "your_url", API_KEY = "your_api_key")

# Specify the model
model = "gpt-4o-mini"

# Create an instance of TheTool
the_tool = TheTool(client=client, model=model)

# Example: Question Detection
detection = the_tool.is_question("Is this project open source?", logprobs=True, top_logprobs=2)
print(detection.result)
print(detection.logprobs)
# Output: True \n --logprobs

# Example: Translation
translation = the_tool.translate("سلام، حالت چطوره؟" target_language="English", with_analysis=True)
print(translation.result)
print(translation.analysis)
# Output: "Hi! How are you?" \n --analysis
```

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (Async)

```python
import asyncio
from openai import AsyncOpenAI
from texttools import AsyncTheTool

async def main():
    # Create your AsyncOpenAI client
    async_client = AsyncOpenAI(base_url="your_url", api_key="your_api_key")

    # Specify the model
    model = "gpt-4o-mini"

    # Create an instance of AsyncTheTool
    the_tool = AsyncTheTool(client=async_client, model=model)

    # Example: Async Translation
    translation = await the_tool.translate("سلام، حالت چطوره؟", target_language="English")
    print(translation.result)
    # Output: "Hi! How are you?"

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📚 Use Cases

Use **TextTools** when you need to:

- 🔍 **Classify** large datasets quickly without model training  
- 🌍 **Translate** and process multilingual corpora with ease  
- 🧩 **Integrate** LLMs into production pipelines (structured outputs)  
- 📊 **Analyze** large text collections using embeddings and categorization  
- 👍 **Automate** common text-processing tasks without reinventing the wheel
