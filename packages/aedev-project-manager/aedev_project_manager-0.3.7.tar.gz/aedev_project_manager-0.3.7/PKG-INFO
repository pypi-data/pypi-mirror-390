# project_manager command line tool

simplifies your programming workflow, in order to:

    * clone or fork projects from GitLab or GitHub
    * push bug fixes and new features of projects to GitLab or GitHub
    * request a MR (merge request) (or a PR (pull request) at GitHub)
    * publish packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org) or [PyPI Test](https://test.pypi.org)
    * deploy Django apps to [PythonAnywhere](https://pythonanywhere.com)  
    * run resource checks (i18n, images, sounds)
    * run unit and integration tests (with coverage reports)
    * use templates to create and maintain code, resource and configuration files
    * bulk refresh/update of mulitple projects, e.g. your namespace portions projects (:pep:`420`)

for more detailed information see the
[manual](https://aedev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man/project_manager.html "project manager manual").

the source code is available at [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/aedev-group/aedev_project_manager)
maintained by the user group [aedev-group](https://gitlab.com/aedev-group).

this project is implemented in pure Python code and based on some portions of the
[__ae__ namespace(Application Environment)](https://ae.readthedocs.io "ae namespace portions on rtd").
