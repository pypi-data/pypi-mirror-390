# Codeborn

**Codeborn** is a free strategic multiplayer game set in a fantasy medieval world. But with a twist.  
Instead of directly controlling your armies, you write Python code that controls your armies.
Your AI makes every decision on your behalf: commanding troops, forging alliances, and besting your enemies in battle.
