# Optimum Intel

🤗 Optimum Intel is the interface between the 🤗 Transformers and Diffusers libraries and the different tools and libraries provided by Intel to accelerate end-to-end pipelines on Intel architectures.

[Intel Extension for PyTorch](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/#introduction) is an open-source library which provides optimizations like faster attention and operators fusion.

Intel [Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) is an open-source library enabling the usage of the most popular compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. It supports automatic accuracy-driven tuning strategies in order for users to easily generate quantized model. The users can easily apply static, dynamic and aware-training quantization approaches while giving an expected accuracy criteria. It also supports different weight pruning techniques enabling the creation of pruned model giving a predefined sparsity target.

[OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai) is an open-source toolkit that enables high performance inference capabilities for Intel CPUs, GPUs, and special DL inference accelerators ([see](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/about-openvino/compatibility-and-support/supported-devices.html) the full list of supported devices). It is supplied with a set of tools to optimize your models with compression techniques such as quantization, pruning and knowledge distillation. Optimum Intel provides a simple interface to optimize your Transformers and Diffusers models, convert them to the OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR) format and run inference using OpenVINO Runtime.


## Installation

To install the latest release of 🤗 Optimum Intel with the corresponding required dependencies, you can use `pip` as follows:

| Accelerator                                                                                                      | Installation                                                         |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Intel Neural Compressor](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/neural-compressor.html) | `pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager "optimum[neural-compressor]"`  |
| [OpenVINO](https://docs.openvino.ai)                                                                             | `pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager "optimum[openvino]"`           |
| [Intel Extension for PyTorch](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/#introduction)                 | `pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager "optimum[ipex]"`               |

The `--upgrade-strategy eager` option is needed to ensure `optimum-intel` is upgraded to the latest version.

We recommend creating a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) and upgrading
pip with `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

Optimum Intel is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install from source with the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git
```

or to install from source including dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install "optimum-intel[extras]"@git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-intel.git
```

where `extras` can be one or more of `ipex`, `neural-compressor`, `openvino`.

# Quick tour

## Neural Compressor

Dynamic quantization can be used through the Optimum CLI:

```bash
optimum-cli inc quantize --model distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad --output ./quantized_distilbert
```
Note that quantization is currently only supported for CPUs (only CPU backends are available), so we will not be utilizing GPUs / CUDA in this example.

You can load many more quantized models hosted on the hub under the Intel organization [`here`](https://huggingface.co/Intel).

For more details on the supported compression techniques, please refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-intel/en/neural_compressor/optimization).

## OpenVINO

Below are examples of how to use OpenVINO and its [NNCF](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/model-optimization-guide/compressing-models-during-training.html) framework to accelerate inference.

#### Export:

It is also possible to export your model to the [OpenVINO IR](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/documentation/openvino-ir-format.html) format with the CLI :

```plain
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B ov_llama/
```

You can also apply 8-bit weight-only quantization when exporting your model : the model linear, embedding and convolution weights will be quantized to INT8, the activations will be kept in floating point precision.

```plain
optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --weight-format int8 ov_llama_int8/
```

Quantization in hybrid mode can be applied to Stable Diffusion pipeline during model export. This involves applying hybrid post-training quantization to the UNet model and weight-only quantization for the rest of the pipeline components. In the hybrid mode, weights in MatMul and Embedding layers are quantized, as well as activations of other layers.

```plain
optimum-cli export openvino --model stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1 --dataset conceptual_captions --weight-format int8 ov_model_sd/
```

To apply quantization on both weights and activations, you can find more information in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-intel/en/openvino/optimization).

#### Inference:

To load a model and run inference with OpenVINO Runtime, you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `OVModelForXxx` class.

```diff
- from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
+ from optimum.intel import OVModelForSeq2SeqLM
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

  model_id = "echarlaix/t5-small-openvino"
- model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
+ model = OVModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  pipe = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
  results = pipe("He never went out without a book under his arm, and he often came back with two.")

  [{'translation_text': "Il n'est jamais sorti sans un livre sous son bras, et il est souvent revenu avec deux."}]
```

#### Quantization:

Post-training static quantization can also be applied. Here is an example on how to apply static quantization on a Whisper model using the [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openslr/librispeech_asr) dataset for the calibration step.

```python
from optimum.intel import OVModelForSpeechSeq2Seq, OVQuantizationConfig

model_id = "openai/whisper-tiny"
q_config = OVQuantizationConfig(dtype="int8", dataset="librispeech", num_samples=50)
q_model = OVModelForSpeechSeq2Seq.from_pretrained(model_id, quantization_config=q_config)

# The directory where the quantized model will be saved
save_dir = "nncf_results"
q_model.save_pretrained(save_dir)
```
You can find more information in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum-intel/en/openvino/optimization).


## IPEX
To load your IPEX model, you can just replace your `AutoModelForXxx` class with the corresponding `IPEXModelForXxx` class. It will load a PyTorch checkpoint, and apply IPEX operators optimization (replaced with customized IPEX operators).
```diff
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline
- from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
+ from optimum.intel import IPEXModelForCausalLM


  model_id = "gpt2"
- model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
+ model = IPEXModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16)
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)
  results = pipe("He's a dreadful magician and")
```

For more details, please refer to the [documentation](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-pytorch/#introduction).
