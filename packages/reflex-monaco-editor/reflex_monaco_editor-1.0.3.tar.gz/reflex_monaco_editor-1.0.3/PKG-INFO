           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Overview

`reflex-monaco-editor` provides integration of the Monaco Editor with support for Terraform syntax highlighting and language features via `terraform-ls`. This project enables embedding a powerful code editor in Python web applications, with extensible language support.

> NOTE: This has not been fully tested in a compiled Reflex app for production. If there are any bugs or issues, please report them.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Install the package

```bash
pip install reflex-monaco-editor
```

### 2. Apply Config

If you're not using any other custom Vite config, you can do this in your `rxconfig.py`:

```python
import reflex as rx
from vite_config_plugin import ViteConfigPlugin
from monaco_editors.config import MonacoEditorsReflexConfig

config = rx.Config(
    ...
    plugins=[
        ...
        ViteConfigPlugin(
            MonacoEditorsReflexConfig.get_vite_config(),
            imports=MonacoEditorsReflexConfig.get_imports(),
            dependencies=MonacoEditorsReflexConfig.get_dependencies(),
        )
    ]
)
```

If you need other custom configurations, do this instead:

```python
import reflex as rx
from vite_config_plugin import ViteConfigPlugin
from monaco_editors.config import MonacoEditorsReflexConfig

config = rx.Config(
    ...
    plugins=[
        ...
        ViteConfigPlugin(
            ..., # your custom vite config for your project
            imports=[
                ..., # your other custom imports
                *MonacoEditorsReflexConfig.get_imports(),
            ],
            dependencies=[
                ..., # your other frontend dependencies
                *MonacoEditorsReflexConfig.get_dependencies()
            ],
            extra_configs=[
                ..., # Any other Vite configs you're merging in your project config
                MonacoEditorsReflexConfig.get_vite_config()
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

The imports, dependencies, and config ensure that Vite handles the necessary libraries correctly.

### 3. Creating a Basic Editor

The minimum required keywork argument is `filename`.

```python
import reflex as rx
from reflex_monaco_editor import monaco_editor

@rx.page("/")
def home() -> rx.Component:
    return rx.flex(
        monaco_editor(filename="demo.txt")
    )
```

> For advanced configuration, see the [API documentation](#api-documentation).

---

## Demo

To run the demo, just clone the repository and either do:

```
pants lock
pants run demo
```

If you have `pants` installed, or:

```
pip install .
reflex run
```

---

## Available Built-In Language Clients

### Terraform

To provide Terraform/HCL language client integration, a VSIX file is included as a shared `rx.asset()` to the editor component and imported by it, and the
`@codingame/monaco-vscode-rollup-vsix-plugin` vite plugin handles the asset loading. This provides the editor with syntax highlighting and other VSCode
editor features, but it does not work with web workers (blame HashiCorp). To get around this, there's a Reflex app lifespan task called `start_terraform_ls`
that you can import and pass to your app on start-up. This will download [lsp-ws-proxy](https://github.com/qualified/lsp-ws-proxy) and
[terraform-ls](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls) binaries from GitHub to your `.web/backend/bin` directory.

#### Lifespan Task

It's not ***required** to use this lifespan task. You can download them yourself, but you will need to ensure they're listening on your specified port
before starting the editor or the language client won't connect.

To use the lifespan task just import and register like this:

```python
from monaco_editors import start_terraform_ls

app = rx.App()
app.register_lifespan_task(start_terraform_ls)
```

#### Editor + Language Client Config

Assuming your `terraform-ls` server is listening on port 9999 on the localhost, here's how you'd need to configure the editor at a minimum:

```python
from monaco_editors import monaco_editor

def editor():
    return monaco_editor(
        filename="main.tf",  # needs to be a standard Terraform/HCL file type.
        language_clients=[
            monaco_editor.language_client(
                language_id="terraform",  # Must be 'terraform'
                url=monaco_editor.server_url(host="localhost", port=9999, secured=False), # configure as needed. The default for `secured` is `True`.
            ),
        ],
    )
```

> See API Documentation for more information on available configurations.

# API Documentation

## Monaco Editor

The `monaco_editor` has the available configuration:

```python
class MonacoEditorReactComp(rx.Component):
    ...
    ###### Required Attributes ######
    # The name of the 'file' to open in the editor.
    filename: str | rx.Var[str]

    ###### Optional Attributes ######
    # Theme configured based on Reflex color mode condition.
    theme = rx.color_mode_cond(dark="Default Dark Modern", light="Default Light Modern")
    # The editor code content of the 'file'
    value: str | rx.Var[str] = ""
    # The name of the worspace/folder/directory of the 'file'.
    workspace_folder: str | rx.Var[str] | None = None
    # Any configured language clients for the editor.
    language_clients: list[LanguageClientConfig] = []  # noqa: RUF012
    # The monaco editor log level (logs to browser console).
    loglevel: Literal["Off", "Trace", "Debug", "Info", "Warning", "Error"] = "Info"
    # The HTML class of the editor window.
    class_name: str = "w-full h-full"

    ###### Configurable Event Handlers ######
    # Fires on editor code content change. Returns the contant as a TextModel object.
    on_change: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(TextModel)]
    # Fires when an user-registered editor command executes. Returns the name of the registered command.
    on_command: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]
    # Fires when a language client is restarted. Returns the name of the editor langauge client that restarts.
    on_restart: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]
    # Fires when an user-registered editor command finishes. Returns the name of the registered command.
    on_command_complete: rx.EventHandler[rx.event.passthrough_event_spec(str)]
```


## Language Client Configs

The `LanguageClientConfig` is a Pydantic model that provides a configured language client to the monaco editor.

```python
class LanguageClientConfig(BaseModel):
    """The Monaco Language Client Config.

    Params:
        language_id (str): The language ID registered with the editor.
        url (LanguageServerUrl): The langauge server URL object.
        register_commands (dict[str, Command]): The mapping of command names and configs to register wuth the editor.
        document_selector (list[str | dict[str, str]] | None): The optional document selector for the LSP.
        initialization_options (dict): The language-specific LSP opts to provide the language server upon connection.
    """
    language_id: str
    url: LanguageServerUrl
    register_commands: Annotated[str, PlainValidator(_var_validator), Field(default="")]
    document_selector: Annotated[list[str | dict[str, str]] | None, Field(default=None)]
    initialization_options: Annotated[str, PlainValidator(_var_validator), Field(default="")]
```

While the `register_commands` and `initialization_options` say the type should be a `str`, it actually accepts an `rx.Var[dict[str, Command]]` and raises a `TypeError`
if the value isn't a Reflex var. This is by design.

> See more about [`register_commands`](#registered-editor-command). The `initialization_options` are LSP or Language Server specific.

## Registered Editor Command

The `Command` Pydantic model helps to register a command between the Monaco editor and the language server, allowing the editor to perform actions
and tasks avaiable to your language server. 

```python
class Command(BaseModel):
    """Language Servers Commands.

    Used to register Monaco editor commands with the language client.

    Params:
        type (Literal["notification", "request"]): The type of LSP command to execute.
        method (str): The LSP method to send (based on the specific language server).
        params (dict[str, Any]): The parameters to send.
        restart_client: (bool): If the editor's language client should be restarted after command completion.
    """
    type: Literal["notification", "request"]

```

### Example:

How this is configured will be dependant on your LSP's documentation. I'll use [`terraform.init`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/main/docs/commands.md#terraforminit)
as an example. 

More often than not, the `type` of request commands use are **request**. This is true for `terraform-ls`. The `method` is the LSP method, in this case it's `workspace/executeCommand`. Based on the [documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-ls/blob/main/docs/commands.md#arguments) for `terraform-ls`, we know the `params` it expects is:

```
{
	"command": "command-name",
	"arguments": [ "key=value" ]
}
```

And `terraform.init` expects an argument of `uri` set to the directory in which to run `init`; making it `[ "uri=file:///path/to/my/dir" ]`. And if a restart of the client is
necessary or benficial, you can set `restart_client` to `True`. This would be the entire `Command` config you'd add to your dict of commands looks like this:

```python
"terraform.init": Command(
    type="request",
    method="workspace/executeCommand",
    params={
        "command": "terraform-ls.terraform.init",
        "arguments": ["uri=file:///path/to/my/dir"]
    },
    restart_client=True
)
```

## Language Server URL

The only currently available method for connecting to a language server is via websocket URL. The `LanguageServerUrl` model
helps specify and format the URL correctly.

```python
class LanguageServerUrl(BaseModel):
    """The language server URL.

    Params:
        host (str): The hostname with a language server websocket.
        port (int): The host's websocket port number.
        secured (bool): Whether the connection is secure (use `wss` instead of `ws`)
        path (str): Additional path URI for the langauge server.
    """
    host: str
    port: int
    secured: Annotated[bool, Field(default=True)]
    path: Annotated[str, Field(default="")]
```

## Namespace

To make it easier (and less imports), all of the major moving parts are grouped into an `rx.ComponentNamespace` for convenient configuration and importing.

```python
class Monaco(rx.ComponentNamespace):
    """Namespace for Monaco editor components and configuration."""

    __call__ = MonacoEditorReactComp.create
    language_client = LanguageClientConfig
    server_url = LanguageServerUrl
    command = Command


monaco_editor = Monaco()
```

So, in your code, all you need to do is:

```python
from monaco_editors import monaco_editor

def my_editor():
    return monaco_editor(
        filename="foo.txt",
        language_clients=[
            monaco_editor.language_client(
                language_id="my-lang",
                url=monaco_editor.server_url(...),
                register_commands={
                    "my-lsp.command": monaco_editor.command(...),
                    ... # other commands
                },
                ... # other options
            )
        ],
        ... # other settings or event handlers
    )
```
