# CRYSTALWINDOW!!!

A tiny but mighty Pygame framework that gives u a full window system, rendering, and GUI power â€” all packed into one file.
No setup pain. No folder chaos. Just import, and there, instant window.

#  Quick Start
    pip install crystalwindow


# How do you make your Own Game with Crystal-Window???
open a new .py file and then do this:

    from crystalwindow import Window  # <- imports everything from crystalwindow (in this case its Window)

    win = Window(800, 600, "Crystal Demo") # <- Window settup.: Window(width, height, name, icon=MyIcon.ico)
    win.run() # <- Runs the game
    win.quit # <- Closes the game (for RAM nd CPU)


Thats it. Run it, and boom instant working window.

# Features

*  Built-in window manager
*  Built-in image n icon loader (with default base64 logo)
*  File-safe startup (even inside PyInstaller)
*  Works offline â€” no extra libs
*  Minimal and clean syntax

# It has a Default Logo

The file includes a variable named DEFAULT_LOGO_BASE64  a lil encoded PNG used when no icon is found.

Use it like: 
    Window(800, 600, "My Window", icon=MyIcon.png)

THERE WE GO u can show it, set it as a window icon, or meme it if u want.

# Example Integration

You can use it as part of ur project (like a game, an editor, or a tool):

    from crystalWindow import Window

    win = Window(800, 600, "My Window", icon=MyIcon.png)

    while win.running:
        win.check_events()
        win.fill((10, 10, 20)) # <- This makes it so you can fill the screen color
        win.run()
        win.quit
