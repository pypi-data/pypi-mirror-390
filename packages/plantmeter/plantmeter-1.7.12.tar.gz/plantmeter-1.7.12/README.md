OpenERP module and library to manage multisite energy generation

## To be extinguished package

Most of the content of this packages is in progress of being
moved to somenergia-generationkwh o generic packages like
somenergia-utils.

Further development should consider continuing this transition.

## Install and test

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest plantmeter # Run unit tests
pytest som_plantmeter/tests # Run erp tests (require a working local erp)
```

Some erp tests clean up collections on the mongo database the erp points to,
which could be a disaster if your dbconfig is pointing to a production setup.
So, those tests are disabled by default.
In order to enable clean room test in erp tests:

- Ensure your dbconfig.py configuration is pointing to a testing database
- Run `enable_destructive_tests.py` from somenergia-utils
- This enables an erp config flag, that makes destrutive testing not to be skipped.
- If, later, you accidentally change dbconfig to point a production setup, and run those tests they won't actually be run

## Code Map

Refer to somenergia-generationkwh documentation on tips on how
the code is structured.

## How to release

- Update the version in README changelogs
- Update the version in setup.py
- Commit "Bump to plantmeter-M.m.p"
- git tag plantmeter-M.m.p
- git push && git push --tags
- The later push will generate the source package in pypi for the non-erp module

    - `gisce` -> `production`
    - `production` -> `production_old`
- `genkwh_mtc`: New collection `rightscorrection`
- Plants have `first/last_active_date`
- Meters have `first/last_active_date`
- New `Aggregator.firstActiveDate()` returning the min of the plant's `first_active_date`

- `genkwh_migrate_1_6_3_newplant.sh`: Script to migrate old plant and incorporate the new one
- In general, fixes to really enable multiple plants
- `genkwh_production.py`: editmix, editplant, editmeter
- `genkwh_production.py`: editmix, editplant, editmeter
- `genkwh_production.py`: delmix, delplant, delmeter
- `genkwh_production.py`: meterset -> editmeter


### plantmeter 1.6.2 2019-01-21

- Deprecated `genkwh_pull_status.py` and `genkwh_pull_status.sh`

- `genkwh_production.py list`: list all the resorce hierarchy (mixes, plants, meters)
- `genkwh_production.py addmix`: to add an aggregator, now 'mix'
- `genkwh_production.py addplant`: to add a plant
- `genkwh_production.py addmeter`: to add a meter
