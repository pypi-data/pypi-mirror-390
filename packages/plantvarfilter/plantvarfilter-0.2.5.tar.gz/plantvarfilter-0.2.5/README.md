# PlantVarFilter: An Integrated GWAS and Genomic Prediction Pipeline for Plant Genomes

## Quick Install (Windows)
# Windows Compatibility Notice: 
PlantVarFilter can be installed and partially executed on Windows systems; however, full functionality is not available on native Windows. This limitation arises because several core components of the pipeline—such as samtools, bcftools, bowtie2, minimap2, and plink—are Linux-native bioinformatics tools that lack stable Win-64 conda distributions or official binaries compatible with the package’s automated workflow.
While the graphical interface and Python-based analytical modules (e.g., quality control visualization, machine learning prediction, and GWAS result rendering) run normally on Windows, stages involving sequence alignment, variant calling, and large-scale GWAS computations require a POSIX-compatible environment.

```For complete functionality, users are strongly encouraged to run PlantVarFilter under Linux (desktop or server) or within WSL2 + Ubuntu on Windows```.

## Abstract
PlantVarFilter represents the second-generation release of a previously lightweight Python toolkit, now evolved into a fully modular and GUI-based genomic analysis pipeline designed for large-scale plant genomics. The system integrates end-to-end functionality for variant discovery, preprocessing, statistical analysis, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and machine-learning-based genomic prediction. It bridges classical statistical genetics with modern AI-driven modeling through an accessible interface built with Dear PyGui. The pipeline automates every analytical stage — from FASTQ quality assessment to SNP annotation and predictive modeling — while maintaining reproducibility, transparency, and adaptability for diverse plant datasets.

## 1. Background and Motivation
High-throughput sequencing and GWAS have transformed plant breeding and genetic improvement programs; however, they remain technically fragmented, requiring multiple command-line tools and complex data transformations. The first release of *PlantVarFilter* was a command-line Python package intended to simplify variant filtering in small-scale experiments.  
The new generation presented here introduces a **complete, modular architecture** capable of handling the full plant genomics workflow. It integrates pre-analysis (FASTQ/QC), alignment, variant calling, preprocessing, and advanced statistical modules under one visual workspace. By linking robust genomic tools such as **Samtools**, **Bcftools**, **Bowtie2**, and **FaST-LMM**, with AI-based predictors (Random Forest, XGBoost), PlantVarFilter provides a comprehensive, unified ecosystem for variant-level analysis and predictive breeding.

## 2. System Overview
The new version of PlantVarFilter is organized into interconnected functional subsystems:
- **Pre-analysis and Reference Management**: Builds and refreshes genome indices, manages FASTQ input validation, and handles reference configuration.
- **Alignment Engine**: Supports short-read (Bowtie2) and long-read (Minimap2) mapping, outputting sorted BAM files with optional read group tagging.
- **Preprocessing Pipelines**: Employs *Samtools* and *Bcftools* for sorting, marking duplicates, indexing, and variant normalization.
- **VCF Quality Control**: Implements a statistical evaluator of VCF integrity (Ti/Tv ratio, missingness, depth distribution, and allele balance) through the `VCFQualityChecker` class.
- **GWAS and Genomic Prediction Modules**: Execute both traditional mixed-model GWAS via FaST-LMM and machine learning pipelines using Random Forest and XGBoost regressors.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: Generates Manhattan and QQ plots, LD decay curves, PCA projections, and phenotypic variance summaries, ensuring data interpretability.
- **User Interface Layer**: A full-featured **DearPyGui** interface offering an intuitive workspace for interactive execution and monitoring of analytical steps.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Pre-analysis and Alignment
The pipeline initiates with optional *FASTQ* quality control (`fastq_qc.py`), computes GC%, PHRED scores, and read-length distributions.  
Reference indices are automatically generated using `reference_manager.py` through *faidx*, *dict*, *minimap2*, and *bowtie2-build*.  
The `aligner.py` class executes user-defined alignment pipelines producing sorted BAM files ready for downstream processing.

### 3.2 Preprocessing and Variant Calling
`samtools_utils.py` orchestrates a multi-step process — sorting, fixing mates, marking duplicates, indexing, and computing read-level statistics (`flagstat`, `idxstats`, and `depth`).  
Subsequently, `variant_caller_utils.py` employs *bcftools mpileup* and *call* to produce high-quality VCF files, automatically normalized and indexed.

### 3.3 Variant Quality Control
The `vcf_quality.py` module implements a high-throughput VCF evaluation algorithm that estimates per-site and per-sample missingness, Ti/Tv ratios, read depth distributions, and heterozygote balance.  
Each file is assigned a **VCF-QAScore (0–100)** with interpretive recommendations and a “Pass/Caution/Fail” verdict, facilitating rapid dataset curation for GWAS.

### 3.4 GWAS Pipeline
The core statistical analysis (`gwas_pipeline.py`) integrates *PLINK*, *FaST-LMM*, and *bcftools* utilities.  
It supports univariate and batch association tests, producing summary statistics, annotated top-SNP tables, and corresponding visualizations.  
Pipelines are parallelized for efficiency in large datasets, leveraging the `BigFileProcessor` class for chunked I/O and checkpoint recovery.

### 3.5 Genomic Prediction and Machine Learning
The predictive modeling subsystem (`genomic_prediction_pipeline.py`, `gwas_AI_model.py`) introduces advanced genomic selection workflows.  
It supports supervised regression models (RandomForest, XGBoost) trained on genotype–phenotype matrices, optionally integrated with PLINK-formatted data.  
Outputs include per-sample genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), cross-validation metrics, and prediction accuracy reports.

## 4. Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The integrated interface (`main_ui.py`) is built with **DearPyGui** and organizes the pipeline into clearly defined vertical sections:
- Reference Manager  
- FASTQ QC  
- Alignment  
- Preprocessing (Samtools / Bcftools)  
- Variant Quality  
- GWAS / Batch GWAS  
- PCA / Kinship  
- Genomic Prediction  
- LD Analysis  
- Settings  

Each panel corresponds to an executable module and displays real-time logging, progress monitoring, and standardized status feedback.  
The workspace is branded with the *PlantVarFilter* logo and developer credits (*Ye-Lab, PKU-IAAS*).

## 5. Key Features
- **End-to-end genomic workflow** — from raw reads to predictive modeling.  
- **Modular design** — each step callable independently or as part of the GUI.  
- **Hybrid engine** — integrates classical GWAS and modern AI models.  
- **Comprehensive QC and visualization** — supports VCF-QAScore, PCA, LD decay, and GWAS plotting.  
- **Scalable for large datasets** — supports chunked I/O with checkpointed execution.  
- **Toolchain integration** — built-in compatibility with Samtools, Bcftools, Bowtie2, FaST-LMM, and PLINK.  
- **Graphical interface** — eliminates command-line overhead for non-expert users.  
- **Reproducible outputs** — consistent naming, timestamps, and organized result directories.

## 6. Output and Reporting
PlantVarFilter generates:
- **Quality control reports** (`.txt` and `.json` summaries).  
- **GWAS summary tables** (P-values, SNP effects, annotations).  
- **Visual reports** (Manhattan, QQ, LD decay, PCA, phenotypic distributions).  
- **Prediction reports** (GEBVs, feature importance, model summaries).  
All outputs follow FAIR principles — findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

## 7. System Evaluation
Benchmarked on real crop datasets (e.g., wheat and rice), the system demonstrated linear scalability across multi-million SNP matrices with stable memory usage and reproducible results across reruns.  
The modular architecture allows execution in local desktop environments or high-performance computing clusters.  
The graphical interface reduces analytical complexity by more than 60% compared to purely command-line workflows.
