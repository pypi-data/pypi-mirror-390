"""
This module provides functions for drawing and manipulating rectangles and polygons on interactive maps.
It serves as a core component for defining geographical regions of interest in the VoxCity library.

Key Features:
    - Interactive rectangle drawing on maps using ipyleaflet
    - Rectangle rotation with coordinate system transformations
    - City-centered map initialization
    - Fixed-dimension rectangle creation from center points
    - Building footprint visualization and polygon drawing
    - Support for both WGS84 and Web Mercator projections
    - Coordinate format handling between (lon,lat) and (lat,lon)

The module maintains consistent coordinate order conventions:
    - Internal storage: (lon,lat) format to match GeoJSON standard
    - ipyleaflet interface: (lat,lon) format as required by the library
    - All return values: (lon,lat) format for consistency

Dependencies:
    - ipyleaflet: For interactive map display and drawing controls
    - pyproj: For coordinate system transformations
    - geopy: For distance calculations
    - shapely: For geometric operations

    Project rectangle to Mercator, rotate, and re-project to lat-lon coordinates.
    
    This function performs a rotation of a rectangle in geographic space by:
    1. Converting coordinates from WGS84 (lat/lon) to Web Mercator projection
    2. Performing the rotation in the projected space for accurate distance preservation
    3. Converting back to WGS84 coordinates
    4. Visualizing the result on the provided map
    
    The rotation is performed around the rectangle's centroid using a standard 2D rotation matrix.
    The function handles coordinate system transformations to ensure geometrically accurate rotations
    despite the distortions inherent in geographic projections.

    Args:
        m (ipyleaflet.Map): Map object to draw the rotated rectangle on.
            The map must be initialized and have a valid center and zoom level.
        rectangle_vertices (list): List of (lon, lat) tuples defining the rectangle vertices.
            The vertices should be ordered in a counter-clockwise direction.
            Example: [(lon1,lat1), (lon2,lat2), (lon3,lat3), (lon4,lat4)]
        angle (float): Rotation angle in degrees.
            Positive angles rotate counter-clockwise.
            Negative angles rotate clockwise.

    Returns:
        list: List of rotated (lon, lat) tuples defining the new rectangle vertices.
            The vertices maintain their original ordering.
            Returns None if no rectangle vertices are provided.

    Note:
        The function uses EPSG:4326 (WGS84) for geographic coordinates and
        EPSG:3857 (Web Mercator) for the rotation calculations.

    The map interface provides:

    allows users to draw arbitrary polygons. It's particularly useful for selecting
    specific buildings or areas within an urban context.

    1. Building Footprint Visualization:
       - Displays building polygons from a GeoDataFrame
       - Uses consistent styling for all buildings
       - Handles simple polygon geometries only
    
    2. Interactive Polygon Drawing:
       - Enables free-form polygon drawing
       - Captures vertices in consistent (lon,lat) format
       - Maintains GeoJSON compatibility
       - Supports multiple polygons with unique IDs and colors
    
    3. Map Initialization:
       - Automatic centering based on input data
       - Fallback to default location if no data provided
       - Support for both building data and rectangle bounds

    Args:
        city (VoxCity, optional): A VoxCity object from which to extract building_gdf 
            and rectangle_vertices. If provided, these values will be used unless 
            explicitly overridden by the building_gdf or rectangle_vertices parameters.
        building_gdf (GeoDataFrame, optional): A GeoDataFrame containing building footprints.
            Must have geometry column with Polygon type features.
            Geometries should be in [lon, lat] coordinate order.
            If None and city is provided, uses city.extras['building_gdf'].
            If None and no city provided, only the base map is displayed.
        rectangle_vertices (list, optional): List of [lon, lat] coordinates defining rectangle corners.
            Used to set the initial map view extent.
            Takes precedence over building_gdf for determining map center.
            If None and city is provided, uses city.extras['rectangle_vertices'].
        zoom (int): Initial zoom level for the map. Default=17.
            Range: 0 (most zoomed out) to 18 (most zoomed in).
            Default of 17 is optimized for building-level detail.

        tuple: (map_object, drawn_polygons)
            - map_object: ipyleaflet Map instance with building footprints and drawing controls
            - drawn_polygons: List of dictionaries with 'id', 'vertices', and 'color' keys for all drawn polygons.
              Each polygon has a unique ID and color for easy identification.

    Examples:
        Using a VoxCity object:
        >>> m, polygons = display_buildings_and_draw_polygon(city=my_city)
        
        Using explicit parameters:

        >>> m, polygons = display_buildings_and_draw_polygon(city=my_city, zoom=15)

    Note:
        - Building footprints are displayed in blue with 20% opacity
        - Only simple Polygon geometries are supported (no MultiPolygons)
        - Drawing tools are restricted to polygon creation only
        - All coordinates are handled in (lon,lat) order internally
        - The function automatically determines appropriate map bounds
        - Each polygon gets a unique ID and different colors for easy identification
        - Use get_polygon_vertices() helper function to extract specific polygon data
