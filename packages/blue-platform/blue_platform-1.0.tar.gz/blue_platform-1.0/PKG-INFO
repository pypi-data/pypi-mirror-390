# What is Blue?

Blue is an agent orchestration platform for building and deploying applications with agentic workflows for the enterprise.

Blue is currently a research project at [Megagon Labs](http://www.megagon.ai) to explore the design space of agent orchestration systems.

This repository contains the blue-platform python library for developing blue agents and the blue platform.

# Want to try out blue?

Best way to start with blue is to install our [blue-cli](http://pypi.org/project/blue-cli) lib, to help you install and deploy blue.

# What can you build with Blue?

Here are a few examples to inspire you to build with blue:

-   a set of agents that convert natural language to SQL, executes, and summarizes results in natural language
-   agents that produces interactive graphical user interfaces and visualizations with your data (e.g. self-service business intelligence)
-   a conversational agent that interfaces to existing predictive models and APIs (e.g. job search agent with predictive models and data)
-   agents that execute workflows processing text data, extracting and populating databases.
