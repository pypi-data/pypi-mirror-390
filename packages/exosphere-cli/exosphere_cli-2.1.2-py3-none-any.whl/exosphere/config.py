    Extends a native dict to store the global options section of the

    Has the following peculiarities vs a native dict:

    - Has many ``from_*`` methods to populate itself from various
      sources such as environment variables, files of various formats
    - Enforces a set of default values for the nested ``options`` dict
    - Enforces unicity for name keys in the ``hosts`` dict.
    - Has a :meth:`deep_update` method to recursively update nested dicts
      without replacing them entirely.

    This configuration structure is strongly inspired by the one used
    by Flask, because good things are worth replicating.
