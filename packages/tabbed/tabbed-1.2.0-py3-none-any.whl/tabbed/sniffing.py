class Sniffer(ReprMixin):
    r"""A tool for inferring the dialect and structure of a CSV file.

    The formatting of CSV files can vary widely. Python's builtin Sniffer is
    capable of handling different dialects (separators, line terminators, quotes
    etc) but assumes the first line within the file is a header or a row of
    unheaded data. In practice, many CSV files contain metadata prior to the
    header or data section. While these files are not compliant with CSV
    standards (RFC-4180), their broad use necessitates file sniffing that infers
    both dialect and structure. To date, some csv readers such as Pandas
    read_csv allow metadata rows to be skipped but no formal mechanism for
    sniffing dialect, metadata and header information exist. This Sniffer
    supports these operations.

    Attributes:
        infile:
            An open file, an IO instance.
        line_count:
            The number of lines in infile.
        start:
            The start line of infile for collecting a sample of 'amount' number
            of lines.
        amount:
            The number of infile lines to sample for dialect, header and
            metadata detection. The initial value defaults to the smaller of
            line_count or 100 lines. The amount should be large enough to
            include some of the data section of the file.
        skips:
            Line numbers to ignore during sample collection.

    Examples:
        >>> import tempfile
        >>> delimiter = ';'
        >>> # make a metadata and add to text that will be written to tempfile
        >>> metadata = {'exp': '3', 'name': 'Paul Dirac', 'date': '11/09/1942'}
        >>> text = [delimiter.join([key, val]) for key, val in metadata.items()]
        >>> # make a header and row to skip and add to text
        >>> header = delimiter.join('group count color'.split())
        >>> to_skip = delimiter.join('please ignore this line'.split())
        >>> text.extend([header, to_skip])
        >>> # make some data rows and add to text
        >>> group = 'a c b b c a c b c a a c'.split()
        >>> count = '22 2 13 15 4 19 4 21 5 24 18 1'.split()
        >>> color = 'r g b b r r r g g  b b g'.split()
        >>> data = [delimiter.join(row) for row in zip(group, count, color)]
        >>> text.extend(data)
        >>> # create a temp file and dump our text
        >>> outfile = tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+')
        >>> _ = outfile.write('\n'.join(text))
        >>> # create a sniffer
        >>> sniffer = Sniffer(outfile)
        >>> # change the sample amount to 10 lines and skip line 4
        >>> # you would know to do this by inspecting the sample property
        >>> # and seeing the problematic line 4
        >>> sniffer.amount = 10
        >>> sniffer.skips = [4]
        >>> sniffer.sniff()
        >>> print(sniffer.dialect)
        SimpleDialect(';', '"', None)

               differ from the last row types and whose length matches the last
               row is taken as the header.
            2. If the last poll rows are all string type. The first row from the
               last with string values that have never been seen in the previous
               rows and whose length matches the last row is taken to be the
               header. Caution, the poll amount should be sufficiently large
               enough to sample the possible string values expected in the data
               section. If the header is not correct, consider increasing the

        Notes:
            If no header is detected this method constructs a header. The names
            in this header are of the form; 'Column_1', ... 'Column_n' where
            n is the expected number of columns from the last row of the sample
            rows.  Just like all other file sniffers, this heuristic will make
            mistakes.  A judicious sample choice that ignores problematic rows
            via the skip parameter may aide detection.
