**Tabbed** is a Python library for reading variably structured text files. It
automatically deduces data start locations, data types and performs iterative
and value-based conditional reading of data rows.

-----------------

## Key Features

- **Structural Inference:**  
A common variant of the
[standard](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180) text file is one that
contains *metadata* prior to a header or data section. Tabbed can locate the
metadata, header and data locations in a file.

- **Type inference:**  
Tabbed can parse `int`, `float`, `complex`, `time`, `date` and `datetime`
instances at high-speed via a polling strategy.

- **Conditional Reading:**  
Tabbed can filter rows during reading with equality, membership, rich
comparison, regular expression matching and custom callables via simple keyword
arguments.

- **Partial and Iterative Reading:**  
Tabbed supports reading of large text files that consumes only as much memory as
you choose.


## Usage

Below is a sample file with a *Metadata* section and *Header* using the tab
character as the delimiter.

**annotations.txt**
```AsciiDoc

```

**Dialect and Type Inference**

Tabbed can detect the dialect via [clevercsv](
https://clevercsv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  and infer the data types.

```python
from tabbed.reading import Reader
from tabbed.samples import paths

infile = open(paths.annotations, 'r')
reader = Reader(infile)
dialect = reader.sniffer.dialect
types, _ = reader.sniffer.types(poll=10)
    
print(dialect) # a clevercsv SimpleDialect
print('---')
print(types)
```

*Output*
```
SimpleDialect('\t', '"', None)
---
[<class 'int'>, <class 'datetime.datetime'>, <class 'datetime.datetime'>, <class 'float'>, <class 'str'>, <class 'str'>]
```

**Metadata and Header detection**

Tabbed can automatically locate the metadata, header and data rows.

```python
print(reader.header)
print('---')
print(reader.metadata())
```

*Output*
```
Header(line=6,
       names=['Number', 'Start_Time', 'End_Time', 'Time_From_Start', 'Channel', 'Annotation'],
       string='Number\tStart Time\tEnd Time\tTime From Start\tChannel\tAnnotation')
---
MetaData(lines=(0, 6),
         string='Experiment ID\tExperiment\nAnimal ID\tAnimal\nResearcher\tTest\nDirectory path\t\n\n')
```

**Filtered Reading with Tabs**

Tabbed supports row and column filtering with equality, membership, rich
comparison and regular expression matching. Its also fully iterative allowing
users to choose the amount of memory to consume during file reading.

```python
from itertools import chain

# tab rows whose Start_Time is between 9:38 and 9:40 and set reader to read
# only the Number and Start_Time columns
reader.tab(
    Start_Time='>= 2/09/2022 9:38:00 and <2/09/2022 9:40:00',
    columns=['Number', 'Start_Time']
)

# read the data to an iterator reading only 2 rows at a time
gen = reader.read(chunksize=2)

# convert to an in-memory list
data = list(chain.from_iterable(gen))
print(data)

# close the reader when done or open under context-management
reader.close()
```

*Output*
```
{'Number': 5, 'Start_Time': datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 9, 9, 38, 1, 262000)}
{'Number': 6, 'Start_Time': datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 9, 9, 38, 7, 909000)}
{'Number': 7, 'Start_Time': datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 9, 9, 38, 20, 258000)}
{'Number': 8, 'Start_Time': datetime.datetime(2022, 2, 9, 9, 38, 25, 435000)}
```

## Documentation
The official documentation is hosted on [github.io](https://mscaudill.github.io/tabbed/).


## Dependencies
Tabbed depends on the excellent [clevercsv](
https://clevercsv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package for dialect detection. The
rest is pure Python.


## Installation

Tabbed is hosted on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/tabbed/) and can be
installed with pip into a virtual environment.

```bash
pip install tabbed
```

To get a development version of `Tabbed` from source start by cloning the
repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mscaudill/tabbed.git
```

Go to the directory you just cloned and create an *editable install* with pip.
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```
