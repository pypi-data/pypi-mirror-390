"""Interactive tutorial implementations for TNFR learning.

This module contains the actual tutorial functions that guide users
through TNFR concepts with executable examples and clear explanations.

Each tutorial is self-contained and can be run independently:
- hello_tnfr(): 5-minute introduction
- biological_example(): Cell communication model
- social_network_example(): Social dynamics simulation  
- technology_example(): Distributed systems analogy

All tutorials maintain TNFR canonical invariants and demonstrate
the 13 structural operators in action.

    This tutorial introduces core TNFR concepts through a simple,
    hands-on example. You'll learn:
    
    - What a node is (Nodo Fractal Resonante - NFR)
    - What EPI means (Primary Information Structure)
    - What structural operators do
    - How to measure coherence C(t) and sense index Si
    - How resonance creates stable networks
    
    The tutorial uses the simplified SDK API, so you can start
    using TNFR immediately without deep theoretical knowledge.
