    Rounding context type.

    Most mathematical operators on numbers

    1. a mathematically-correct operation over real numbers,
    interpreting numbers as real numbers;

    2. a rounding operation to limit the number significant digits
    and decide how the "lost" digits will affect the final output.

    Thus, rounding enforces a particular "format" for numbers,
    but they should just be considered unbounded real numbers
