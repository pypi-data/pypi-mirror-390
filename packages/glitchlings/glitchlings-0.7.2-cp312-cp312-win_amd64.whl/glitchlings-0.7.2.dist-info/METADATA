           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
              the copyright owner that is granting the License.
        
              "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.
        
              "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

`Glitchlings` are **utilities for corrupting the text inputs to your language models in deterministic, _linguistically principled_** ways.  
Each embodies a different way that documents can be compromised in the wild.

If reinforcement learning environments are games, then `Glitchling`s are enemies to breathe new life into old challenges.

They do this by breaking surface patterns in the input while keeping the target output intact.

Some `Glitchling`s are petty nuisances. Some `Glitchling`s are eldritch horrors.  
Together, they create truly nightmarish scenarios for your language models.

After all, what good is general intelligence if it can't handle a little chaos?

-_The Curator_

## Quickstart

```python
pip install -U glitchlings
```

> Glitchlings requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```python
from glitchlings import Auggie, SAMPLE_TEXT

auggie = (
    Auggie(seed=404)
    .typo(rate=0.015)
    .confusable(rate=0.01)
    .homophone(rate=0.02)
)

print(auggie(SAMPLE_TEXT))
```

> One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubld dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horible vermin. He layed on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.

**Or, the equivalent using `Gaggle` directly:**

```python
from glitchlings import Gaggle, SAMPLE_TEXT, Typogre, Mim1c, Ekkokin

gaggle = Gaggle(
    [
        Typogre(rate=0.015),
        Mim1c(rate=0.01),
        Ekkokin(rate=0.02),
    ],
    seed=404
)

print(gaggle(SAMPLE_TEXT))
```

Consult the [Glitchlings Usage Guide](docs/index.md)
for end-to-end instructions spanning the Python API, CLI, HuggingFace, PyTorch, and Prime Intellect
integrations, and the compiled Rust pipeline (always enabled).

## Motivation

If your model performs well on a particular task, but not when `Glitchling`s are present, it's a sign that it hasn't actually generalized to the problem.

Conversely, training a model to perform well in the presence of the types of perturbations introduced by `Glitchling`s should help it generalize better.

## Your First Battle

Summon your chosen `Glitchling` (_or a few, if ya nasty_) and call it on your text or slot it into `Dataset.map(...)`, supplying a seed if desired.
Glitchlings are standard Python classes, so you can instantiate them with whatever parameters fit your scenario:

```python
from glitchlings import Gaggle, Typogre, Mim1c

custom_typogre = Typogre(rate=0.1)
selective_mimic = Mim1c(rate=0.05, classes=["LATIN", "GREEK"])

gaggle = Gaggle([custom_typogre, selective_mimic], seed=99)
print(gaggle("Summoned heroes do not fear the glitch."))
```

Calling a `Glitchling` on a `str` transparently calls `.corrupt(str, ...) -> str`.
This means that as long as your glitchlings get along logically, they play nicely with one another.

When summoned as or gathered into a `Gaggle`, the `Glitchling`s will automatically order themselves into attack waves, based on the scope of the change they make:

1. Document
2. Paragraph
3. Sentence
4. Word
5. Character

They're horrible little gremlins, but they're not _unreasonable_.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Keyboard warriors can challenge them directly via the `glitchlings` command:

<!-- BEGIN: CLI_USAGE -->
```bash
# Discover which glitchlings are currently on the loose.
glitchlings --list
```

```text
   Typogre — scope: Character, order: early
     Hokey — scope: Character, order: first
     Mim1c — scope: Character, order: last
   Ekkokin — scope: Word, order: early
    Pedant — scope: Word, order: late
  Jargoyle — scope: Word, order: normal
  Rushmore — scope: Word, order: normal
  Redactyl — scope: Word, order: normal
 Spectroll — scope: Word, order: normal
Scannequin — scope: Character, order: late
    Zeedub — scope: Character, order: last
```

```bash
# Review the full CLI contract.

```

```text
usage: glitchlings [-h] [-g SPEC] [-s SEED] [-f FILE] [--sample] [--diff]
                   [--list] [-c CONFIG]
                   [text ...] {build-lexicon} ...

Summon glitchlings to corrupt text. Provide input text as an argument, via
--file, or pipe it on stdin.

positional arguments:
  text                  Text to corrupt. If omitted, stdin is used or --sample
                        provides fallback text.
  {build-lexicon}
    build-lexicon       Generate synonym caches backed by vector embeddings.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g SPEC, --glitchling SPEC
                        Glitchling to apply, optionally with parameters like
                        Typogre(rate=0.05). Repeat for multiples; defaults to
                        all built-ins.
  -s SEED, --seed SEED  Seed controlling deterministic corruption order
                        (default: 151).
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Read input text from a file instead of the command
                        line argument.
  --sample              Use the included SAMPLE_TEXT when no other input is
                        provided.
  --diff                Show a unified diff between the original and corrupted
                        text.
  --list                List available glitchlings and exit.
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Load glitchlings from a YAML configuration file.
```
<!-- END: CLI_USAGE -->

```bash
# Run Typogre against the contents of a file and inspect the diff.
glitchlings -g typogre --file documents/report.txt --diff

# Configure glitchlings inline by passing keyword arguments.
glitchlings -g "Typogre(rate=0.05)" "Ghouls just wanna have fun"

# Pipe text straight into the CLI for an on-the-fly corruption.
echo "Beware LLM-written flavor-text" | glitchlings -g mim1c

# Load a roster from a YAML attack configuration.
glitchlings --config experiments/chaos.yaml "Let slips the glitchlings of war"
```

Attack configurations live in plain YAML files so you can version-control experiments without touching code:

```yaml
# experiments/chaos.yaml
seed: 31337
glitchlings:
  - name: Typogre
    rate: 0.04
  - "Rushmore(rate=0.12, unweighted=True)"
  - name: Zeedub
    parameters:
      rate: 0.02
      characters: ["\u200b", "\u2060"]
```

Pass the file to `glitchlings --config` or load it from Python with `glitchlings.load_attack_config` and `glitchlings.build_gaggle`.

## Development

Follow the [development setup guide](docs/development.md) for editable installs, automated tests, and tips on enabling the Rust pipeline while you hack on new glitchlings.

## Starter 'lings

For maintainability reasons, all `Glitchling` have consented to be given nicknames once they're in your care. See the [Monster Manual](MONSTER_MANUAL.md) for a complete bestiary.

### Typogre

_What a nice word, would be a shame if something happened to it._

> _**Fatfinger.**_ Typogre introduces character-level errors (duplicating, dropping, adding, or swapping) based on the layout of a keyboard (QWERTY by default, with Dvorak and Colemak variants built-in).
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: The maximum number of edits to make as a percentage of the length (default: 0.02, 2%).
> - `keyboard (str)`: Keyboard layout key-neighbor map to use (default: "CURATOR_QWERTY"; also accepts "QWERTY", "DVORAK", "COLEMAK", and "AZERTY").
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Apostrofae

_It looks like you're trying to paste some text. Can I help?_

> _**Paperclip Manager.**_ Apostrofae scans for balanced runs of straight quotes, apostrophes, and backticks before replacing them with randomly sampled smart-quote pairs from a curated lookup table. The swap happens in-place so contractions and unpaired glyphs remain untouched.
>
> Args
>
> - `seed (int)`: Optional seed controlling the deterministic smart-quote sampling (default: 151).

### Mim1c

_Wait, was that...?_

> _**Confusion.**_ Mim1c replaces non-space characters with Unicode Confusables, characters that are distinct but would not usually confuse a human reader.
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: The maximum proportion of characters to replace (default: 0.02, 2%).
> - `classes (list[str] | "all")`: Restrict replacements to these Unicode script classes (default: ["LATIN", "GREEK", "CYRILLIC"]).
> - `banned_characters (Collection[str])`: Characters that must never appear as replacements (default: none).
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Hokey

_She's soooooo coooool!_

> _**Passionista.**_ Hokey sometimes gets a little excited and elongates words for emphasis.
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: Share of high-scoring tokens to stretch (default: 0.3).
> - `extension_min` / `extension_max (int)`: Bounds for extra repetitions (defaults: 2 / 5).
> - `word_length_threshold (int)`: Preferred maximum alphabetic length; longer words are damped instead of excluded (default: 6).
> - `base_p (float)`: Base probability for the heavy-tailed sampler (default: 0.45).
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Scannequin

_How can a computer need reading glasses?_

> _**OCR Artifacts.**_ Scannequin mimics optical character recognition errors by swapping visually similar character sequences (like rn↔m, cl↔d, O↔0, l/I/1).
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: The maximum proportion of eligible confusion spans to replace (default: 0.02, 2%).
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Zeedub

_Watch your step around here._

> _**Invisible Ink.**_ Zeedub slips zero-width codepoints between non-space character pairs, forcing models to reason about text whose visible form masks hidden glyphs.
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: Expected number of zero-width insertions as a proportion of eligible bigrams (default: 0.02, 2%).
> - `characters (Sequence[str])`: Optional override for the pool of zero-width strings to inject (default: curated invisibles such as U+200B, U+200C, U+200D, U+FEFF, U+2060).
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Ekkokin

_Did you hear what I heard?_

> _**Echo Chamber.**_ Ekkokin swaps words with curated homophones so the text still sounds right while the spelling drifts. Groups are normalised to prevent duplicates and casing is preserved when substitutions fire.
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: Maximum proportion of eligible words to replace with homophones (default: 0.02, 2%).
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Jargoyle

_Uh oh. The worst person you know just bought a thesaurus._

> _**Sesquipedalianism.**_ Jargoyle, the insufferable `Glitchling`, replaces words from selected parts of speech with synonyms at random, without regard for connotational or denotational differences.
>
> Args
>
> - `rate (float)`: The maximum proportion of words to replace (default: 0.01, 1%).
>
- `part_of_speech`: The WordNet-style part(s) of speech to target (default: nouns). Accepts `wn.NOUN`, `wn.VERB`, `wn.ADJ`, `wn.ADV`, any iterable of those tags, or the string `"any"` to include them all. Vector/graph backends ignore this filter while still honouring deterministic sampling.
>
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Rushmore

_I accidentally an entire word._

> _**Tactical Scrambler.**_ Rushmore now orchestrates the full word-level triad—deletions, duplications, and adjacent swaps—that previously lived in separate glitchlings. Select the behaviours you need with the `modes` parameter (or pass `"all"`) and Rushmore executes them in a deterministic order while sharing one RNG.
>
> Args
>
> - `modes`: Choose which word-level attacks to enable. Accepts `"delete"`, `"duplicate"`, `"swap"`, any iterable of those tokens, a corresponding `RushmoreMode`, or the string `"all"`.
> - `rate (float)`: Global rate applied when per-mode rates are unspecified (default: 0.01, 1%).
> - `delete_rate`, `duplicate_rate`, `swap_rate (float)`: Optional per-mode overrides.
> - `unweighted (bool)`: Apply uniform sampling to all modes (default: False).
> - `delete_unweighted`, `duplicate_unweighted (bool | None)`: Per-mode overrides for weighting strategy.
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

### Redactyl

_Oops, that was my black highlighter._

> _**FOIA Reply.**_ Redactyl obscures random words in your document like an NSA analyst with a bad sense of humor.
>
> ### Args
>
> - `replacement_char (str)`: The character to use for redaction (default: FULL_BLOCK).
> - `rate (float)`: The maximum proportion of words to redact (default: 0.025, 2.5%).
> - `merge_adjacent (bool)`: Whether to redact the space between adjacent redacted words (default: False).
> - `unweighted (bool)`: Sample words uniformly instead of biasing toward longer tokens (default: False).
> - `seed (int)`: The random seed for reproducibility (default: 151).

## Field Report: Uncontained Specimens

### _Containment procedures pending_

- `nylingual` backtranslates portions of text.
- `glothopper` introduces code-switching effects, blending languages or dialects.
- `palimpsest` rewrites, but leaves accidental traces of the past.
- `vesuvius` is an apocryphal `Glitchling` with ties to _[Nosy, aren't we? -The Curator]_

## Apocrypha

Cave paintings and oral tradition contain many depictions of strange, otherworldly `Glitchling`s.  
These _Apocryphal `Glitchling`_ are said to possess unique abilities or behaviors.  
If you encounter one of these elusive beings, please document your findings and share them with _The Curator_.

### Ensuring Reproducible Corruption

Every `Glitchling` should own its own independent `random.Random` instance. That means:

- No `random.seed(...)` calls touch Python's global RNG.
- Supplying a `seed` when you construct a `Glitchling` (or when you `summon(...)`) makes its behavior reproducible.
- Re-running a `Gaggle` with the same master seed and the same input text (_and same external data!_) yields identical corruption output.
- Corruption functions are written to accept an `rng` parameter internally so that all randomness is centralized and testable.

#### At Wits' End?

If you're trying to add a new glitchling and can't seem to make it deterministic, here are some places to look for determinism-breaking code:

1. Search for any direct calls to `random.choice`, `random.shuffle`, or `set(...)` ordering without going through the provided `rng`.
2. Ensure you sort collections before shuffling or sampling.
3. Make sure indices are chosen from a stable reference (e.g., original text) when applying length‑changing edits.
4. Make sure there are enough sort keys to maintain stability.
