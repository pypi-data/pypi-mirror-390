    Enhanced version of quadratic_mpr() that can read sample coordinates from
    tree sequence metadata and return an augmented tree sequence with inferred
    ancestral locations.
    
    Args:
        ts: Tree sequence object
        sample_locations: Sample coordinate array, or None to read from metadata
        use_branch_lengths: Whether to weight distances by branch lengths
        location_key: Metadata key for location information
        coordinates_key: Key for coordinate arrays in nested metadata
        return_augmented_ts: Whether to return augmented tree sequence
    
    Returns:
        If return_augmented_ts=False: MPRResult object
        If return_augmented_ts=True: Tuple of (MPRResult, augmented TreeSequence)
    
    Examples:
        >>> # Read coordinates from individual metadata
        >>> result, ts_with_coords = gaiapy.quadratic_mpr_with_metadata(
        ...     ts, location_key="sampling_location", coordinates_key="coordinates"
        ... )
        >>> 
        >>> # Access inferred locations from augmented tree sequence
        >>> for node in ts_with_coords.nodes():
        ...     if node.metadata and "inferred_location" in node.metadata:
        ...         print(f"Node {node.id}: {node.metadata['inferred_location']}")
    
    Notes:
        Particularly useful for continuous space ancestry inference where
        sample coordinates are stored as part of individual metadata.
        The augmented tree sequence contains inferred (x,y) coordinates
        for all ancestral nodes.
        
        Based on the quadratic parsimony implementation in 
        src/treeseq_sankoff_quadratic.c with enhanced metadata integration.

        locations than quadratic distance, making it suitable for datasets
        with potential location errors or extreme geographic distributions.
        
        Implements the piecewise linear algorithm from src/treeseq_sankoff_linear.c
        based on Csurös (2008) with full metadata integration.
