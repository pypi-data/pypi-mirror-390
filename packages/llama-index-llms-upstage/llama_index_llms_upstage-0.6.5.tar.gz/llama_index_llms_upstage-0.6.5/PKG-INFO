# LlamaIndex Llms Integration: Upstage

[Upstage](https://www.upstage.ai/) is a leading artificial intelligence (AI) company specializing in delivering above-human-grade performance LLM components.

## Solar LLM

Solar Mini Chat is a fast yet powerful advanced large language model focusing on English and Korean. It has been specifically fine-tuned for multi-turn chat purposes, showing enhanced performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, like multi-turn conversation or tasks that require an understanding of long contexts, such as RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), compared to other models of a similar size. This fine-tuning equips it with the ability to handle longer conversations more effectively, making it particularly adept for interactive applications.
