Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning - Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning - Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning - Learning through trial and error

Popular ML Libraries:
- Scikit-learn for classical ML
- TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning
- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical computations
