# quickhost plugins

The AWS plugin for [quickhost](https://pypi.org/project/quickhost/) - start hosts in AWS
quickly from the command line, with minimal configuration and state.

Test coverage is 79%

## Install

[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) is the recommended way to install quickhost and its plugins.

pipx inject quickhost quickhost-aws
```

### Usage

Note: the `--region` option is silently ignored. All resources are created in us-east-1.

```
# set up aws credentials and essential resources in aws
# this creates a user named "quickhost-user," which will be responsible for any quickhost actions.
# The region supplied is where hosts will run, unless specified otherwise
quickhost -vvv aws init --admin-profile define-admin

# you have nothing running yet
quickhost -vvv aws list-all

# start a linux host
quickhost -vvv aws make my_app

# see that your host is running
quickhost -vvv aws list-all

# permanently get rid of what you made above
quickhost -vvv aws destroy my_app

# permanently get rid of aws resources made by quickhost including any apps still running
quickhost -vvv aws plugin-destroy

```
