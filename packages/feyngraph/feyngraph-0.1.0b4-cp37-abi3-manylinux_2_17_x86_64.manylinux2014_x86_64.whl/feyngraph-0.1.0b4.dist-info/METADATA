# FeynGraph - A Modern Feynman Diagram Generator

> [!WARNING]
> FeynGraph is currently still in the testing phase. The core algorithms are validated to operate as expected, but some small bugs may still appear. If this is the case, please file an [issue](https://github.com/Jens-Braun/FeynGraph/issues/new).

FeynGraph is a modern Feynman diagram generation toolkit aiming to be as versatile as possible while remaining pleasant to use. The library itself is written in Rust, additional language bindings are available for Python and Wolfram Mathematica.

A user guide is available [here](https://jens-braun.github.io/FeynGraph/).

# Installation
## Python
The FeynGraph Python bindings are published to PyPI and can therefore easily installed with e.g. `pip`
```
pip install feyngraph
```
In addition to the library interface, there is also a more classical [command line utility](https://jens-braun.github.io/FeynGraph/usage/cli/). This requires some extra dependencies, which can be installed with e.g.
```
pip install feyngraph[cli]
```
### Building From Source
The FeynGraph Python library can also easily be built from source, which requires a [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [`maturin`](https://www.maturin.rs/). Then, in the cloned repository, a Python wheel can be compiled by running
```
maturin build -r
```
The library can also immediately be installed by running
```
pip install .
```
## Rust
To use FeynGraph in a Rust project, it can simply be added to the project with
```
cargo add feyngraph
```
or be manually added to `Cargo.toml` as
```toml
[dependencies]
feyngraph = "0.1"
```

# Basic Example
The Feynman diagrams of a given process in the Standard Model in Feynman gauge without filtering can be generated by running:

```python
import feyngraph as fg
diags = fg.generate_diagrams(["g", "g"], ["g", "g"], 2)
assert(len(diags) == 88366)
```
