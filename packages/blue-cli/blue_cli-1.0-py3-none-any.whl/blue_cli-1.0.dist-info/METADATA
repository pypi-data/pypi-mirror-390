# What is Blue?

Blue is an agent orchestration platform for building and deploying applications with agentic workflows for the enterprise. 

Blue is currently a research project at [Megagon Labs](http://www.megagon.ai) to explore the design space of agent orchestration systems. 

This repository contains the blue-cli python library for installing and deploying blue platform..

# Want to try out blue?

To install the latest stable version, use:

```
pip install blue-cli
```


# What can you build with Blue?

Here are a few examples to inspire you to build with blue:

* a set of agents that convert natural language to SQL, executes, and summarizes results in natural language 
* agents that produces interactive graphical user interfaces and visualizations with your data (e.g. self-service business intelligence) 
* a conversational agent that interfaces to existing predictive models and APIs (e.g. job search agent with predictive models and data)
* agents that execute workflows processing text data, extracting and populating databases.
