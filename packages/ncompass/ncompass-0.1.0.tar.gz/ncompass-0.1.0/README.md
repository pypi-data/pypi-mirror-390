High-performance AI inference SDK with built-in tracing and profiling capabilities. Built by [nCompass Technologies](https://ncompass.tech).

## Features

- **🚀 High-Performance GPU Kernels** - Custom-built kernels optimized for AI inference
- **📊 Advanced Profiling** - Built-in performance monitoring and health metrics
- **🤖 AI-Powered Analysis** - Intelligent trace analysis and bottleneck identification
- **🔄 Iterative Optimization** - Progressive profiling workflow for targeted improvements
- **🎯 AST-Level Instrumentation** - Automatic code instrumentation without manual changes
- **⚡ Production-Ready** - Separate development and production configurations

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install ncompass
```

## Quick Start

```python
from ncompass.trace import ProfilingSession

# Initialize profiling session
session = ProfilingSession(
    trace_output_dir="./traces",
    cache_dir="./cache"
)

# Profile your inference code
def my_inference():
    # Your model inference here
    outputs = model(inputs)
    return outputs

# Run profiling
trace_path = session.run_profile(my_inference)

# Get AI-powered insights
summary = session.get_trace_summary(trace_path)
print(summary['markdown'])
```

## Core Capabilities

### Iterative Profiling Workflow

```python
# 1. Capture initial trace
trace = session.run_profile(inference_fn)

# 2. Get AI analysis
summary = session.get_trace_summary(trace)

# 3. Submit feedback for targeted profiling
session.submit_feedback(
    feedback_text="Why is attention slow?",
    target_module="model.attention",
    start_line=100,
    end_line=200
)

# 4. Apply targeted markers and re-run
session.apply_targeted_markers()
trace = session.run_profile(inference_fn)
```

### AST-Level Instrumentation

```python
from ncompass.trace import enable_rewrites, RewriteConfig

# Enable automatic code instrumentation
config = RewriteConfig(targets={...})
enable_rewrites(config=config)

# Your code runs with automatic profiling markers
run_inference()
```

### Trace Filtering

```python
# Filter traces to focus on key operations
filtered_trace = session.filter_trace(
    include_cuda_kernels=True,
    min_duration_us=100.0
)
```

## Development

### Coverage & Quality Tools

All development and coverage tools are in the **`tools/`** directory:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run coverage checks (from tools/ directory)
cd tools
make all-checks         # Run all checks
make coverage           # Unit test coverage
make docstring-coverage # Docstring coverage
make type-stats         # Type hint coverage
make lint               # Run linters
make format             # Auto-format code
```

See **[tools/COVERAGE.md](tools/COVERAGE.md)** for comprehensive documentation.
