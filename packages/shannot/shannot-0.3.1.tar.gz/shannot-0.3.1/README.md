**Shannot** lets LLM agents and automated tools safely explore your Linux systems without risk of modification. Built on [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap), it provides hardened sandboxing for system diagnostics, monitoring, and exploration - perfect for giving Claude or other AI assistants safe access to your servers.

> Claude __shannot__ do *that!*

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install UV (recommended - handles Python 3.10+ requirement automatically)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install Shannot
uv tool install shannot

# On Linux: install bubblewrap
sudo apt install bubblewrap  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install bubblewrap  # Fedora/RHEL

# Run commands in sandbox
shannot ls /
shannot df -h
shannot cat /etc/os-release
```

**Alternative:** `pip install shannot` (requires Python 3.10+, may conflict with system package managers)

See [Installation Guide](https://corv89.github.io/shannot/installation/) for details.

## Profiles

Control what commands are allowed with JSON profiles:

```bash
shannot ls /                          # Uses minimal.json (default)
shannot --profile diagnostics df -h   # System monitoring commands
shannot --profile systemd journalctl  # Journal access
```

See [Profile Configuration](https://corv89.github.io/shannot/profiles/) for customization.


## Python API

```python
from shannot import SandboxManager, load_profile_from_path

profile = load_profile_from_path("diagnostics.json")
manager = SandboxManager(profile)

result = manager.run(["df", "-h"])
print(result.stdout)
```

See [API Reference](https://corv89.github.io/shannot/api/) for details.
