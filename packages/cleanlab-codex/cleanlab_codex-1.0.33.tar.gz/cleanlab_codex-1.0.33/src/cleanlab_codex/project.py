        Supply the same `messages` that your LLM used to generate its response (formatted as OpenAI-style chat messages),
        including all past user/assistant messages, and any preceding system messages (including any retrieved context).

        **For single-turn Q&A apps, `messages` can be a minimal list with one user message containing all relevant info that was supplied to your LLM.
        For multi-turn conversations, provide the full dialog leading up to the final response (not including the final response).

        If your AI response is flagged as problematic, then this method will:
            - return an expert answer if one was previously provided for a similar query
            - otherwise log this query for future SME review (to consider providing an expert answer) in the Web interface.

        Args:
            messages (list[ChatCompletionMessageParam]): The full prompt given to your LLM that generated the response, in the OpenAI Chat Completions format.
                This must include the final user message that triggered the AI response. This must include all of the state that was supplied to your LLM (including: full conversation history, system instructions/prompt, retrieved context, etc).
            response (ChatCompletion | str): Your AI-response that was generated by LLM given the same `messages`. This is the response being evaluated, and should not appear in the `messages`.
            query (str): The core user query that the `response` is answering, i.e. the latest user message in `messages`. Specifying the `query` (as a part of the full `messages` object) enables Cleanlab to: match this against other users' queries (e.g. for serving expert answers), run certain Evals, and display the query in the Web Interface.
            context (str): All retrieved context (e.g., from your RAG/retrieval/search system) that was supplied as part of `messages` for generating the LLM `response`. Specifying the `context` (as a part of the full `messages` object) enables Cleanlab to run certain Evals and display the retrieved context in the Web Inferface.
            rewritten_query (str, optional): An optional reformulation of `query` (e.g. to form a self-contained question out of a multi-turn conversation history) to improve retrieval quality. If you are using a query-rewriter in your RAG system, you can provide its output here. If not provided, Cleanlab may internally do its own query rewrite when necessary.
            metadata (object, optional): Arbitrary metadata to associate with this LLM `response` for logging/analytics inside the Project.
            tools (list[ChatCompletionToolParam], optional): Optional definitions of tools that were provided to the LLM in the response-generation call. Should match the `tools` argument in OpenAI's Chat Completions API. When provided to the LLM, its response might be to call one of these tools rather than natural language.
            eval_scores (dict[str, float], optional): Pre-computed evaluation scores to bypass automatic scoring. Providing `eval_scores` for specific evaluations bypasses automated scoring and uses the supplied scores instead. If you already have them pre-computed, this can reduce runtime.

        Returns:
            ProjectValidateResponse: A structured object with the following fields:

                - should_guardrail (bool): True if the AI system should suppress or modify the response before returning it to the user. When True, the response is considered problematic and may require further review or modification.
                - escalated_to_sme (bool): True if the query should be escalated to SME for review. When True, the query is logged and may be answered by an expert.
                - eval_scores (dict[str, ThresholdedEvalScore]): Evaluation scores for different response attributes (e.g., trustworthiness, helpfulness, ...). Each includes a numeric score and a `failed` flag indicating whether the score falls below threshold.
                - expert_answer (str | None): If it was auto-determined that this query should be escalated to SME, and a prior SME answer for a similar query was found, then this will return that expert answer.  Otherwise, it is None.
                - expert_guardrail_override_explanation (str | None): If the final guardrail decision was overridden by expert review, this will contain an explanation for why the guardrail result was overridden. Otherwise, it is None.
                - log_id (str): The ID of the log created for this query.

                When available, consider swapping your AI response with the expert answer before serving the response to your user.
