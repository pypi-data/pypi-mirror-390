Codex enables you to seamlessly leverage knowledge from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to improve your RAG/Agentic applications.

The `cleanlab-codex` library provides a simple interface to integrate Codex's capabilities into your RAG application.
See immediate impact with just a few lines of code!

## Demo

Install the package:

```console
pip install cleanlab-codex
```

Integrating Codex into your RAG application is as simple as:

```python
from cleanlab_codex import Project
project = Project.from_access_key(...)

# Your existing RAG code:
context = rag_retrieve_context(user_query)
prompt = rag_form_prompt(user_query, retrieved_context)
response = rag_generate_response(prompt)

# Detect bad responses and remediate with Cleanlab
results = project.validate(query=query, context=context, response=response,
    messages=[..., prompt])

final_response = (
    results["expert_answer"] # Codex's answer
    if results["expert_answer"] is not None
    else response # Your RAG system's initial response
)
```

<!-- TODO: add demo video -->
<!-- Video should show Codex added to a RAG system, question asked that requires knowledge from an outside expert, Codex used to ask an outside expert, and expert response returned to the user -->

## Why Codex?
- **Detect Knowledge Gaps and Hallucinations**: Codex identifies knowledge gaps and incorrect/untrustworthy responses in your AI application, to help you know which questions require expert input.
- **Save SME time**: Codex ensures that SMEs see the most critical knowledge gaps first.
- **Easy Integration**: Integrate Codex into any RAG/Agentic application with just a few lines of code.
- **Immediate Impact**: SME answers instantly improve your AI, without any additional Engineering/technical work.
