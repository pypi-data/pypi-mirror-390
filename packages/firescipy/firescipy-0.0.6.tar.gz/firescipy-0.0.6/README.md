## Contributing

Contributions to this package are welcome!

Please feel free to use the [discussions forum](https://github.com/FireDynamics/FireSciPy/discussions) or the [issue tracker](https://github.com/FireDynamics/FireSciPy/issues) to get in contact with us. From there, we can talk about your ideas and see how to implement them.

Note: From version 0.1.0 onward, the main branch should contain only stable versions and no development on the main branch is permitted. Create new branches for development work, regardless if it is for fixing bugs or adding new features.

Practical summary for contributions directly to the repo:

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/FireDynamics/FireSciPy/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/fooBar`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some fooBar'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/fooBar`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
