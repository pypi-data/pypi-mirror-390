## Basic Functionality

This basic example tests that your PowerBI report can be parsed and reassembled by ``pbi_core``. 


```python3 linenums="1"

from pbi_core import LocalReport

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example.pbix")  # (1)!
report.save_pbix("example_out.pbix")  # (1)!
```

!!! danger "Common Issue"

    One of the current limitations in the `pbi_core` library is the incomplete [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) typing of the Layout file, especially of the properties of visual elements. 

    If you encounter an error message for this, please reate an issue on the [Github page](https://github.com/douglassimonsen/pbi_core/issues) with the error message. If you're able, attaching a `pbix` file will make the fix quicker and can be added to the test suite to ensure the issue doesn't re-appear in future versions.

    The vast majority of these issues are due to properties that are missing from the field definition of classes. To allow them to be parsed as simple dictionaries, you can update the `cattrs` Converter in `pbi_core\attrs\cattrs.py` to use `forbid_extra_keys=False` in the source code.

## Altering Data model

This example shows how you can add automatic descriptions to PowerBI columns (possibly from some governance tool??)


```python3 linenums="1"

from pbi_core import LocalReport

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example.pbix")
for column in report.ssas.columns:
    # Keys are system columns that can't be viewed or altered in PowerBI
    if column.is_key:
        continue
    column.description = "pbi_core has touched this"
# save_pbix will automatically update the SSAS model before saving to file
report.save_pbix("example_out.pbix")
```

## Exporting records in SSAS tables

This example shows how to find SSAS records and extract data from report columns

```python3 linenums="1"
from pbi_core import LocalReport

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example_pbis/api.pbix")
values = report.ssas.columns.find({"name": "a"}).data()
print(values)
values2 = report.ssas.tables.find({"name": "Table"}).data()
print(values2)

measure = report.ssas.measures.find({"name": "Measure"})
# Note: the first column is a hidden row-count column that can't be used in measures
column = [x for x in measure.table().columns() if not x.is_key][0]
values3 = measure.data(column, head=10)
print(values3)
```

## Generating Lineage Charts

This example displays a lineage chart in HTML:

```python3 linenums="1"
from pbi_core import LocalReport

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example.pbix", kill_ssas_on_exit=True)
col = report.ssas.columns.find({"name": "MeasureColumn"})
# Can also generate a "children" lineage chart
# Can also call to_markdown() to embed the results in markdown
col.get_lineage("parents").to_mermaid().show()
```
Example lineage output:

![Example Lineage Chart](_images/quick_start_lineage.png){: style="height:150px"}


## Improved Multilanguage Support

This example displays the ability to easily convert PBIX reports to alternate languages:

```python linenums="1"
from pbi_core import LocalReport
from pbi_core.misc.internationalization import get_static_elements, set_static_elements

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example.pbix", kill_ssas_on_exit=True)
x = get_static_elements(report.static_files.layout)
x.to_excel("multilang.xlsx")

set_static_elements("multilang1.xlsx", "example.pbix")
```

## Automatic Data Model Cleaning

One of the core tensions in PowerBI is the size of the data model. In development, you want to have many measures, columns, and tables to simplify new visual creation. After developing the report, the additional elements create two issues:

1. It's difficult to understand which elements are being used and how they relate to each other
2. The additional columns and tables can slow down visual rendering times, negatively impacting UX

pbi_core has an automatic element culler that allows you to remove unnecessary elements after the report has been designed:

```python linenums="1"

from pbi_core import LocalReport

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example_pbis/api.pbix")
report.cleanse_ssas_model()
report.save_pbix("cull_out.pbix")
```

## Performance Analysis

This example shows how to analyze the performance of a Power BI report's visual:

!!! warning

    In the previous implementations, the performance trace occassionally hangs for 2-5 minutes. The library has solved this by pinging the SSAS server during the trace with a trivial `EVALUATE {1}` command. Although this seems to have fixed the issue, it clearly doesn't touch the root issue. Therefore, if the trace hangs, you may need to kill and restart the process.


```python linenums="1"

from pbi_core import LocalReport

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example_pbis/example_section_visibility.pbix")
# x = report.static_files.layout.sections[0].visualContainers[0].get_performance(report.ssas)
perf = report.static_files.layout.sections[0].get_performance(report.ssas)
print(perf)
print("=================")
print(perf[0].pprint())
```

Which generates the following output.

```shell

)

```

### Custom DAX Commands

You can also trace custom DAX commands like so:


```python linenums="1"
import pbi_core

command = "EVALUATE {1}"
report = pbi_core.LocalReport.load_pbix("example_pbis/api.pbix")
with report.ssas.get_performance_trace() as perf_trace:
    perf = perf_trace.get_performance(command)
print(perf[0])
```   

Which generates the following output:

```shell

```

## Styling Layout Elements

This example shows how to apply style changes to elements in a PowerBI report globally. This ensures consistent styling and protects hands from carpal tunnel.

!!! note "Alternate Selection Methods"

    We also included two alternate methods of finding elements on lines 8 and 9. You can pass dictionaries of attribute/value pairs or a function returning a boolean and only elements matching those will return. One downside of these methods in this case is that `Slicer` is a more specific type than `BaseVisual`. The return of the `find_all` method returns `list[<input type>]`, so the more specific type of `Slicer` will provide better autocompletion if your IDE supports it. For instance, the `Slicer` class knows there's an `objects` attribute and it's children, but the `BaseVisual` doesn't.

```python linenums="1"
from pbi_core import LocalReport
from pbi_core.static_files.layout.visuals.properties.base import SolidColorExpression
from pbi_core.static_files.layout.visuals.slicer import Slicer

report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example_pbis/api.pbix", load_ssas=False, load_static_files=True)
slicers = report.static_files.layout.find_all(Slicer)
# from pbi_core.static_files.layout.visuals.base import BaseVisual
# slicers = report.static_files.layout.find_all(BaseVisual, {"visualType": "slicer"})
# slicers = report.static_files.layout.find_all(BaseVisual, lambda v: v.visualType == "slicer")
for s in slicers:
    new_color = SolidColorExpression.from_hex("#FF0000")
    s.objects.header[0].properties.fontColor = new_color
    s.objects.items[0].properties.fontColor = new_color
report.save_pbix("example_out.pbix")

```

## Creating New Measures

This example shows how to add a measure to a table in a report. 

!!! note "Other Entities"

    This general setup works for all SSAS entities that can be created. There are some cases where the 
    relationships are not what you'd expect coming from working in the PowerBI Desktop. Be sure to visit
    the [Layout ERD](/ssas/ssas_erd.md) page to see how various objects relate to each other!

```python
from pbi_core import LocalReport
from pbi_core.ssas.model_tables import LocalMeasure

ssas_report = LocalReport.load_pbix("example_pbis/api.pbix")
# We avoid hidden and private tables so that you can find the measure when you open the output report!
# In most reports, there are hidden tables for each auto-date hierarchy in the model
table = ssas_report.ssas.tables.find(lambda t: t.is_hidden is False and t.is_private is False)
m = LocalMeasure(
    name="New Measure",
    table_id=table.id,
    # This expression could be any valid DAX expression
    expression="1",
).load(ssas_report.ssas)
ssas_report.save_pbix("out.pbix")
```
