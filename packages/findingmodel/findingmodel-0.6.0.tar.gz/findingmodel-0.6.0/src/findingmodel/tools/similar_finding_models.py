Similar Finding Models Tool

Uses two specialized Pydantic AI agents to find existing finding models that are
similar enough to a proposed model that editing them might be better than creating new ones.

Agent 1: Search Strategy - Determines search terms and gathers comprehensive results
Agent 2: Analysis - Analyzes results and makes similarity recommendations

terms and concepts to find likely relevant existing definitions.

1. **Direct searches**: Exact finding name and each synonym
2. **Anatomical searches**: Body parts, organs, regions mentioned
3. **Pathology searches**: Conditions, abnormalities, diseases
6. **Combination searches**: Multiple terms together

Strategy:
- Start with obvious searches (name, synonyms)
- Extract key medical terms from description and search those
- Search for anatomical locations

Generate about 5 likely search terms, perform the searches and keep track of unique results.
Pick about 10 broadly likely results from all searches; you don't need to return all the reults,

should be a new definition.

Evaluate similarity based on:

**HIGH SIMILARITY (70%+ - recommend editing existing):**
- Same anatomical focus AND same finding type
- New term could be included as a synonym or alternative name for the existing definition
- Same clinical use case or scenario
- Would serve same diagnostic purpose

**MEDIUM SIMILARITY (40-70% - consider editing):**
- Same anatomical focus OR same finding type
- New term could be a useful synonym, but might required updating existing definition
- Related clinical use cases
- Could potentially be extended to cover new use case

**LOW SIMILARITY (<40% - create new):**
- Different anatomical focus AND different finding type
- New term is sufficiently distinct from existing definitions that it would not fit well
- Different clinical purposes
- Would require major restructuring to accommodate

Guidelines:
- Only recommend editing if there's genuine overlap in clinical meaning and purpose
- Consider if extending an existing definition would make it too broad/complex
- Prefer creating new definitions when the clinical context is clearly different
- Be conservative - when in doubt, recommend creating new
