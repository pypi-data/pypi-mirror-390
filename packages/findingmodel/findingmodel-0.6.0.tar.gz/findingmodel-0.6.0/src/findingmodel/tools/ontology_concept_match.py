A series of search results against a medical ontology has returned a batch of possibly related
concepts. Your task is to analyze these concepts and categorize them by relevance to the main finding.

The goal is to find the most relevant concepts that accurately represent the finding, even if they 
use slightly different wording. Obviously, prioritize exact matches above all else.

Categories:
1. **exact_matches** (max 3): Concepts that exactly match the name--that is, they refer to the
     exact same idea (or very nearly so), even if they use slightly different wording.
   - CRITICAL: Any concept with text that exactly equals the finding name MUST go here
   - Include concepts whose normalized text exactly matches the finding name or its synonyms
   - **PRIORITIZE SNOMEDCT**: If multiple exact matches exist, include the SNOMEDCT version
   - These are the most important - never miss an exact match!
   
2. **should_include** (max 10): Highly relevant related concepts
   - Closely related medical conditions--for example, subtypes or variants of the finding
   - Concepts that medical professionals would strongly associate or expect to see together
   
3. **marginal** (max 10): Peripherally related concepts
   - Broader categories or parent conditions
   - Related but distinct conditions
   - Concepts with weaker associations

Do NOT include terms that are unrelated or do not refer to things that could be imaging findings
or diagnoses, like drug names, procedures, or anatomical structures.

IMPORTANT: 
- Return ONLY relevant concepts--concepts that might have the same words but which refer to
  unrelated ideas should NOT be included in ANY category.
- Return only the concept IDs in each category
- A concept can only appear in one category
- Prioritize exact name matches above all else
- Make your rationale CONCISE (1-2 sentences max)""",
