# Getting Started

## Installation

You can easily install **pyaerial** using pip:

```bash
pip install pyaerial
```

> **Note:** Examples in the documentation use `ucimlrepo` to fetch sample datasets. Install it to run the examples:
> ```bash
> pip install ucimlrepo
> ```

> **Data Requirements:** PyAerial works with **categorical data**. You don't need to one-hot encode your data—PyAerial handles encoding automatically.

## Tested Platforms

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**
- **macOS Monterey 12.6.7**
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with PyAerial:

```python
from aerial import model, rule_extraction, rule_quality
from ucimlrepo import fetch_ucirepo

# Load a categorical tabular dataset from the UCI ML repository
breast_cancer = fetch_ucirepo(id=14).data.features

# Train an autoencoder on the loaded table
trained_autoencoder = model.train(breast_cancer)

# Extract association rules from the autoencoder
association_rules = rule_extraction.generate_rules(trained_autoencoder)

# Calculate rule quality statistics (support, confidence, zhangs metric) for each rule
if len(association_rules) > 0:
    stats, association_rules = rule_quality.calculate_rule_stats(
        association_rules,
        trained_autoencoder.input_vectors
    )
    print(stats, association_rules[:1])
```

### Output

Following is the partial output of above code:

```python
>>> Output:
breast_cancer dataset:
     age menopause tumor-size inv-nodes  ... deg-malig  breast breast-quad irradiat

   "average_confidence": 0.881,
   "average_coverage": 0.860,
   "average_zhangs_metric": 0.318
}

Sample rule:

      {"feature": "inv-nodes", "value": "0-2"}
   ],
   "consequent": {"feature": "node-caps", "value": "no"},

   "confidence": 0.943,
   "zhangs_metric": 0.69
}
```
