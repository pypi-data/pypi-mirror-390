def test_force_distance_close_values():
    """
    Tests force_distance with values that are too close together,
    forcing an adjustment to satisfy the minimum distance.

    Input:
        [1, 1.1] with distance=2.

    The transformation sets:
        target[0] = 1, allowed interval for y[0] is [0, 2];
        target[1] = 1.1 - 2 = -0.9, allowed interval for y[1] is [-1.9, 0.1].
    Since 1 > -0.9, pooling forces both y values to their pooled average,
    which after clipping becomes approximately 0.05.
    Reconstructing x gives:
        x[0] = 0.05, x[1] = 0.05 + 2 = 2.05.

    Expected output:
