# Context Selector - When to Use Which Layer

**🎯 Guide for Choosing Between AI-Optimized and Human-Comprehensive Layers**

🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Context Selection Entry Requirements
- [ ] AI vs Human layer differences understood ✅/❌
- [ ] Context selection criteria reviewed ✅/❌
- [ ] Layer commitment requirement acknowledged ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: If mixing AI-optimized and human-comprehensive contexts inappropriately

## 🛑 **USE AI-OPTIMIZED LAYER WHEN EXECUTION**

⚠️ MUST-READ: Context selection determines framework execution efficiency and success

### **Primary AI Consumption**
- Generating test code
- Following framework phases  
- Using templates and patterns
- Quick reference during execution
- Validating quality requirements

### **File Size Constraints**
- Need information under 100 lines
- Processing multiple files simultaneously
- Cross-referencing between components
- Real-time framework execution

### **Template-Driven Tasks**
- Creating unit tests with standard fixtures
- Implementing integration tests with real APIs
- Following established patterns
- Applying quality enforcement rules

## 👥 **USE COMPREHENSIVE LAYER WHEN:**

### **Deep Understanding Required**
- Understanding complete architecture
- Making framework modifications
- Researching design decisions
- Planning major changes

### **Human Review and Planning**
- Stakeholder presentations
- Architecture discussions
- Framework evolution planning
- Complete requirement analysis

### **Implementation Details**
- Setting up development environment
- Understanding complex dependencies
- Debugging framework issues
- Complete technical specifications

## 🔄 **HYBRID USAGE PATTERNS**

### **AI + Human Collaboration**
```
1. Human reviews comprehensive layer for planning
2. AI uses optimized layer for execution  
3. Human validates results against comprehensive specs
4. AI iterates using optimized templates
```

### **Progressive Detail**
```
1. Start with ai-optimized/README.md (quick overview)
2. Use ai-optimized/templates/ for code generation
3. Reference comprehensive/ for complex decisions
4. Return to ai-optimized/ for continued execution
```

## 📊 **DECISION MATRIX**

| Task | AI-Optimized | Comprehensive | Reason |
|------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Generate unit tests | ✅ | ❌ | Templates + fixtures |
| Plan framework changes | ❌ | ✅ | Need complete context |
| Execute quality gates | ✅ | ❌ | Quick validation rules |
| Understand architecture | ❌ | ✅ | Complex relationships |
| Use standard fixtures | ✅ | ❌ | Simple patterns |
| Debug framework issues | ❌ | ✅ | Deep technical details |
