# Phase 5: Evidence Collection Framework

**🎯 Systematic Evidence Collection and Validation for Coverage Analysis**

## 🚨 **ENTRY REQUIREMENTS**
🛑 VALIDATE-GATE: Evidence Collection Prerequisites
- [ ] All Phase 5 tasks completed (5.1-5.5) with evidence ✅/❌
- [ ] Path strategy selected and configured (unit OR integration) ✅/❌
- [ ] All previous progress table updates completed ✅/❌

🚨 FRAMEWORK-VIOLATION: If any Phase 5 tasks incomplete or missing evidence

## 📊 **CONSOLIDATED EVIDENCE TABLE**

### **Phase 5 Master Results**
| Component | Status | Evidence | Quality Gate |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Line Coverage Analysis | ✅ COMPLETE | X total lines, Y executable | PASS |
| Branch Coverage Analysis | ✅ COMPLETE | X branches, Y conditions | PASS |
| Function Coverage Analysis | ✅ COMPLETE | X functions, Y public | PASS |
| Unit Strategy | ✅ COMPLETE | 90%+ coverage targets set | PASS |
| Integration Strategy | ✅ COMPLETE | Functionality focus defined | PASS |

### **Quantified Totals**
- **Total lines**: [NUMBER]
- **Executable lines**: [NUMBER]
- **Branches to cover**: [NUMBER]
- **Functions to test**: [NUMBER]
- **Unit coverage target**: 90%+ lines, 85%+ branches
- **Integration approach**: Functionality validation (no metrics)

## 🚨 **FINAL VALIDATION CHECKPOINT**

### **Completeness Gate**
- [ ] All 5 coverage components completed with evidence
- [ ] Path strategy selected and configured
- [ ] Evidence table updated with actual numbers
- [ ] Quality gates passed for all components

### **Archive Parity Verification**
- [ ] Line coverage analysis matches archive depth
- [ ] Branch coverage analysis comprehensive
