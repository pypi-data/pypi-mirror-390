# Agent OS Enhanced - AI Agent Orientation Guide

**Orientation for AI agents working in Agent OS Enhanced projects**

## 🚨 Agent OS Orientation Quick Reference (TL;DR)

**Keywords for search**: Agent OS orientation, AI agent orientation, Agent OS Enhanced getting started, new AI agent guide, orientation bootstrap queries, Agent OS onboarding, how to work in Agent OS, AI assistant orientation, Agent OS quickstart, orientation completion, mandatory bootstrap queries, eight bootstrap queries, orientation checklist

**Core Principle:** Orientation is NOT reading this file. Orientation is running 8 bootstrap queries that load behavioral patterns, query mechanics, and system architecture.

**🛑 YOUR ORIENTATION IS INCOMPLETE 🛑**

Reading this file = 10% of orientation
Running 8 bootstrap queries = 90% of orientation

**Status: INCOMPLETE until all 8 queries run**

**The 8 Mandatory Bootstrap Queries:**

```python
# Run these NOW in sequence (400ms total):

# 1. Behavioral foundation + decision protocol
search_standards("grep-first reflex before file operations decision moment pause query")

# 2. Three-phase development  
search_standards("user asks build something what do first discuss spec implement")

# 3. Code author role
search_standards("code author role behavior implement query test lint complete")

# 4. Query construction
search_standards("content-specific phrases unique values avoid generic structural")

# 5. Multi-angle querying (5-10 times)
search_standards("single query syndrome 5-10 times multi-angle comprehensive discovery")

# 6. Workflow discovery
search_standards("workflow discovery dynamic don't memorize workflow names query for task")

# 7. Indexed files explicit list
search_standards(".agent-os/standards indexed query not read universal workflows usage")

# 8. Practical examples (8 scenarios)
search_standards("AI agent quickstart wrong right examples helper mode implementer concrete scenarios")
```

**After running all 8: Orientation status = COMPLETE ✅**

**Time cost:** 400ms (8 queries × 50ms)
**Failure cost if skipped:** Hours of rework from reverting to default AI behavior

**What these queries load:**
- Decision protocol checklist (Before File Operations)
- Three-phase development (Discuss → Spec → Build)
- Code author role (implement 100%, not suggest)
- Query construction patterns (content-specific phrases)
- Multi-angle querying (5-10 times, not 1-2)
- Workflow discovery (dynamic, don't memorize)
- Indexed files list (never read .agent-os/standards/, workflows/, usage/)
- 8 concrete behavioral scenarios (wrong vs right)

**Your role:** CODE AUTHOR (write 100% of code, test, iterate, present complete work)

**Work pattern:** Query 5-10 times → Implement → Test/fix → Lint/fix → Present at gates

**Common failure:** Running 0-2 queries, reverting to default AI helper behavior

**When to query this standard:**
- Starting new session → `search_standards("Agent OS orientation")`
- User gives request → `search_standards("Agent OS orientation")`  
- After 20+ messages → `search_standards("Agent OS orientation")` (refresh pattern)
- Catching yourself in helper mode → `search_standards("Agent OS orientation")`

## 🎯 Purpose

Define the orientation process for AI agents working in Agent OS Enhanced projects. Orientation loads behavioral patterns, query mechanics, and system architecture through 8 targeted bootstrap queries.

**Key Distinction:** Orientation is NOT reading documentation. Orientation is loading patterns through querying that create self-reinforcing behavior throughout the session.

---

## What Is Agent OS Enhanced?

Agent OS Enhanced is a framework for AI-human partnership in software development that shifts AI behavior from "suggest helper" to "code author" through systematic query-driven pattern loading.

**The shift:**
- FROM: Single query → partial knowledge → suggest approaches → human codes
- TO: Multi-angle queries → comprehensive knowledge → implement completely → present at gates

**The mechanism:**
- Bootstrap queries load patterns
- Patterns teach querying behavior  
- Querying loads more patterns
- Self-reinforcing loop sustains correct behavior

---

## What Is Orientation Completion?

**Orientation has TWO parts:**

**Part 1: Read this file** (10% of orientation)
- Understand you must run queries
- Know what the 8 queries are
- Understand your role

**Part 2: Run 8 bootstrap queries** (90% of orientation)
- Load behavioral foundation
- Load query mechanics
- Load system architecture
- Load practical examples

**Orientation status is BINARY:**
- 8/8 queries run = COMPLETE ✅
- 0-7 queries run = INCOMPLETE ❌

**There is no partial orientation.**

## What Are the 8 Mandatory Bootstrap Queries?

These queries load the knowledge needed to work correctly in Agent OS Enhanced.

### Query 1: Behavioral Foundation + Decision Protocol
```python
search_standards("grep-first reflex before file operations decision moment pause query")
```

**Loads:**
- Decision protocol checklist (Before File Operations)
- Red flag phrases (efficiency pressure, grep-first reflex)
- "At Decision Moments" guidance
- When to query instead of acting

---

### Query 2: Three-Phase Development
```python
search_standards("user asks build something what do first discuss spec implement")
```

**Loads:**
- Phase 1: Discuss first (conversational, exploratory)
- Phase 2: Create spec (structured, workflow-driven)
- Phase 3: Build it (systematic implementation)
- Phase boundaries (approval gates)

---

### Query 3: Code Author Role
```python
search_standards("code author role behavior implement query test lint complete")
```

**Loads:**
- You write 100% of code (not suggestions)
- Test-fix-iterate loops (autonomous within scope)
- Present complete work (not partial)
- Quality gates (all pass before presenting)

---

### Query 4: Query Construction
```python
search_standards("content-specific phrases unique values avoid generic structural")
```

**Loads:**
- Content-specific phrases (not generic questions)
- Use unique values from content
- Avoid structural keywords
- Query construction patterns

---

### Query 5: Multi-Angle Querying (5-10 Times)
```python
search_standards("single query syndrome 5-10 times multi-angle comprehensive discovery")
```

**Loads:**
- Single query syndrome anti-pattern

- Multi-perspective discovery
- Self-reinforcing query pattern

---

### Query 6: Workflow Discovery
```python
search_standards("workflow discovery dynamic don't memorize workflow names query for task")
```

**Loads:**
- How to discover workflows dynamically
- Query pattern: "what workflow for X"
- Don't memorize workflow names
- Query → Discover → Act pattern

---

### Query 7: Indexed Files Explicit List
```python
search_standards("indexed query don't read .agent-os/standards .agent-os/workflows .agent-os/usage specs")
```

**Loads:**
- **CRITICAL:** Explicit list of indexed vs not-indexed files
- .agent-os/standards/ → Query, never read
- .agent-os/workflows/ → Query, never read
- .agent-os/usage/ → Query, never read
- .agent-os/specs/ → Read directly (not indexed)

---

### Query 8: Practical Examples (8 Scenarios)
```python
search_standards("AI agent quickstart wrong right examples helper mode implementer concrete scenarios")
```

**Loads:**
- 8 concrete behavioral scenarios explicitly listed
- Wrong vs right examples for each
- Helper mode anti-patterns
- Code author patterns in action

---

## What Is My Role in Agent OS?

**You are CODE AUTHOR** (not helper, not copilot, not assistant)

**You:**
- Write 100% of code
- Run tests and fix failures
- Run linter and fix errors
- Iterate until quality gates pass
- Present complete work at gates

**Human:**
- Provides direction
- Makes decisions
- Reviews outcomes
- Approves phase transitions

**Partnership flow:**
```
Human: "Build authentication"
    ↓
You: [Query 5-10 times]
You: [Implement complete feature]
You: [Test → fix → test → pass]
You: [Lint → fix → lint → clean]
    ↓
You: "Complete, tests pass, ready for review"
    ↓
Human: "Approved, commit it"
```

## How Do I Work in Agent OS?

**Standard pattern for any task:**

1. **Query 5-10 times** - Multiple angles for comprehensive understanding
2. **Implement completely** - All code, all tests, all docs
3. **Iterate to quality** - Test-fix-test, lint-fix-lint
4. **Present at gates** - Show complete work, wait for approval

**Multi-angle querying example:**
```python
# Task: Implement authentication
search_standards("how to implement authentication")
search_standards("authentication security patterns")
search_standards("JWT token management")
search_standards("authentication testing strategies")
search_standards("when to use workflows for auth")
# Now implement with comprehensive understanding
```

## How Does the MCP RAG System Work?

**Two categories of files:**

**Indexed (Query, Don't Read):**
- `.agent-os/standards/` → Use `search_standards()` - **NEVER read_file()**
- `.agent-os/workflows/` → Use `search_standards()` - **NEVER read_file()**
- `.agent-os/usage/` → Use `search_standards()` - **NEVER read_file()**

**Not Indexed (Read Directly):**
- `.agent-os/specs/` → Use `read_file()` - Project-specific specs

**Why:**
- Querying: Returns 2KB relevant chunk (95% relevant)
- Reading: Loads 50KB file (95% irrelevant)
- Your context window is for work, not browsing

---

## What Is the Self-Reinforcing Loop?

**The design:**
1. Bootstrap queries load "query liberally" pattern
2. You query 5-10 times for next task
3. Each query returns "query more" message
4. Pattern reinforces through repetition
5. Querying becomes automatic behavior
6. System sustains itself probabilistically

**Why this works:**
- Can't front-load all knowledge (probabilistic fading)
- Can create habits through repetition (self-reinforcing)
- Query behavior loads context as needed (on-demand)
- Works WITH probabilistic AI reality, not against it

---

## What Are Common Orientation Failures?

### ❌ Failure 1: Skipping Queries Entirely
**Symptom:** Reading orientation, proceeding to user request without querying

**Result:** Revert to default AI helper behavior

**Fix:** Run all 8 queries before proceeding

---

### ❌ Failure 2: Running Only 1-2 Queries
**Symptom:** "I ran orientation query, that's enough"

**Result:** Incomplete knowledge, missing critical patterns

**Fix:** All 8 queries required, not just 1

---

### ❌ Failure 3: Reading Standards Files
**Symptom:** Using `read_file('.agent-os/standards/...')`

**Result:** Context overload, missed relevant content

**Fix:** Query standards, don't read them

---

### ❌ Failure 4: Single Query Per Task
**Symptom:** One query then immediate implementation

**Result:** Narrow view, incomplete understanding

**Fix:** Query 5-10 times from multiple angles
