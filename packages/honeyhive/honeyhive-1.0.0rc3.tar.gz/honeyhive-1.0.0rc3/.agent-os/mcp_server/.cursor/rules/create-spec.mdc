# Create Specification

Create a comprehensive specification for a feature following Agent OS standards.

## Usage

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Create spec for [feature]"
- "I need a spec for [feature]"
- "Let's spec out [feature]"

## Workflow

### 1. Query Standards First
```
Use MCP: search_standards("creating specifications standards")
Review spec structure and requirements
```

### 2. Gather Context
Ask the user:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who is this for?
- What are the success criteria?
- What's the technical approach?

### 3. Create Spec Directory
```
.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/
├── README.md         # Executive summary
├── srd.md           # Requirements (goals, users, criteria)
├── specs.md         # Technical design
├── tasks.md         # Implementation breakdown
└── implementation.md # Detailed guidance
```

### 4. Write Each Document

**README.md:**
- Problem statement
- Solution overview
- Success metrics
- Links to detailed docs

**srd.md (Software Requirements Document):**
- Business goals
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Constraints

**specs.md (Technical Specifications):**
- Architecture overview
- API specifications
- Data models
- Workflow/process flow
- Security considerations
- Performance considerations
- Testing strategy

**tasks.md (Implementation Tasks):**
- Phased task breakdown
- Dependencies between tasks
- Estimated time per task
- Acceptance criteria per task
- Validation gates between phases

**implementation.md (Detailed Guidance):**
- Code patterns to use
- Testing approach
- Deployment steps
- Troubleshooting guide

### 5. Review with User
- Walk through each document
- Refine based on feedback
- Ensure tasks are clear and actionable

## Output

A complete specification in `.agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name/` ready for implementation.

## Next Step

Tell user: "Spec created! Use `execute-tasks` to implement, or review tasks.md and work through them."

## Standards Applied

- Follows `.agent-os/usage/creating-specs.md`
- Uses Sphinx-style docstrings
- Includes production code checklist references
- Phase-gated with validation criteria
