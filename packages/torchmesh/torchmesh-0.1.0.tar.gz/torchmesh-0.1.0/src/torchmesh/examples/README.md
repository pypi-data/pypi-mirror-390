# Torchmesh Examples

This module provides a comprehensive collection of canonical meshes for tutorials, testing, and experimentation. All meshes are generated at runtime and organized by category and dimensional configuration.

## Quick Start

```python
from torchmesh import examples

# Load a simple sphere
mesh = examples.surfaces.sphere_icosahedral.load(radius=1.0, subdivisions=2)

# Load the Stanford bunny
mesh = examples.pyvista_datasets.bunny.load()

# Create a lumpy sphere with noise
mesh = examples.procedural.lumpy_sphere.load(noise_amplitude=0.1)
```

## Dimensional Coverage

The examples provide complete coverage of all useful dimensional configurations:

- **1D→2D**: Curves in the plane (circles, spirals, etc.)
- **1D→3D**: Space curves (helix, knots, etc.)
- **2D→2D**: Planar triangulations (squares, circles, polygons)
- **2D→3D**: Surface meshes (spheres, cylinders, tori, etc.)
- **3D→3D**: Volume meshes (tetrahedral solids)

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Loading

```python
from torchmesh import examples

# Most examples use the load() function
mesh = examples.surfaces.sphere_icosahedral.load(device="cpu")
```

### Parametric Control

```python
# Adjust resolution
sphere_coarse = examples.surfaces.sphere_icosahedral.load(subdivisions=1)
sphere_fine = examples.surfaces.sphere_icosahedral.load(subdivisions=4)

# Adjust size
cylinder_small = examples.surfaces.cylinder.load(radius=0.5, height=1.0)
cylinder_large = examples.surfaces.cylinder.load(radius=2.0, height=5.0)
```

### Device Selection

```python
# CPU
mesh_cpu = examples.pyvista_datasets.bunny.load(device="cpu")

# GPU (if available)
mesh_gpu = examples.pyvista_datasets.bunny.load(device="cuda")
```

### Procedural Variations

```python
# Create base mesh
base_sphere = examples.surfaces.sphere_icosahedral.load(subdivisions=3)

# Add noise
noisy_sphere = examples.procedural.noisy_mesh.load(
    base_mesh=base_sphere,
    noise_scale=0.05,
    seed=42
)

# Or use pre-made lumpy sphere
lumpy = examples.procedural.lumpy_sphere.load(
    noise_amplitude=0.1,
    seed=42
)
```

## Design Principles

1. **One file per mesh**: Each mesh type is in its own file for clarity
2. **Consistent interface**: All meshes use `load()` function
3. **Runtime generation**: No cached files (except PyVista's auto-caching)
4. **Parametric**: Most meshes accept resolution/size parameters
5. **Device-aware**: All meshes support device selection
6. **Well-documented**: Each mesh includes dimensional info and properties

## Testing

These examples are used throughout the torchmesh test suite. You can also use them in your own tests:

```python
def test_my_algorithm():
    from torchmesh import examples
    
    # Test on various mesh types
    for mesh_loader in [
        examples.surfaces.sphere_icosahedral.load,
        examples.pyvista_datasets.bunny.load,
        examples.surfaces.torus.load,
    ]:
        mesh = mesh_loader()
        result = my_algorithm(mesh)
        assert result is not None
```
