"""Action Frames.

The Action Frames implement the UMIM standard for frame processors.
See here to learn more about the UMIM standard:
https://docs.nvidia.com/ace/umim/latest/index.html

Note that at the moment the support for action frames is limited to the animation graph service.
More services and support for additional action frames will be added in the future.
