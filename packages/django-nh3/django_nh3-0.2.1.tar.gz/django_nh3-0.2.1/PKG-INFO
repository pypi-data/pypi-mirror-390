Django integration with for nh3, Python binding to Ammonia HTML sanitizer Rust crate.

`nh3 docs`_

Requirements
------------

Python 3.10 to 3.13 supported.

Django 3.2 to 5.1 supported.


.. _nh3 docs: https://nh3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest



Contributing
------------

The project is in it's infancy, setup because of `bleach becoming deprecated`_.

It is setup with pre-commit to maintain code quality. This includes black for formatting, ruff for linting & checks.
This is much like django, so currently referring to django's own `style docs`_ will be most helpful

To contribute, fork the repo and clone your fork to your machine. Then setup a virtual environment however you prefer to do this.
Then run the following setup the basics:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install pre-commit tox-uv
   pre-commit install

Tox is used to run tests locally and on github. The test requirements are generated using pip-tools via ``requirements/compile.py``.
