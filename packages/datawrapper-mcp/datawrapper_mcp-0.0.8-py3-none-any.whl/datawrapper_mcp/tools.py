"""Tool definitions for the Datawrapper MCP server.

This module previously contained tool definitions for the low-level MCP Server implementation.
After refactoring to FastMCP, all tool definitions are now in server.py using @mcp.tool() decorators.
This file is kept for backwards compatibility and may contain shared utilities in the future.
