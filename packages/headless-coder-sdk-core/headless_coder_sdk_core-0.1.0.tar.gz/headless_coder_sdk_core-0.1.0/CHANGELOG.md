# Changelog

## 0.1.0 – First release

We are thrilled to introduce `headless-coder-sdk-core` to PyPI! This package delivers the shared registry, adapter interfaces, thread handles, and utility helpers that mirror the TypeScript project, making it effortless to plug in different AI coders from Python.
