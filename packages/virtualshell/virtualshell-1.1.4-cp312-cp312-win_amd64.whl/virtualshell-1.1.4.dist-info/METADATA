            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# virtualshell

High-performance PowerShell automation for Python. `virtualshell` keeps a single PowerShell host warm and exposes it through a thin Python wrapper backed by a C++ engine. The result: millisecond-scale latency, async execution, and session persistence without juggling subprocesses.

> Full documentation now lives in the [project wiki](https://github.com/Chamoswor/virtualshell/wiki). This README gives you the essentials and quick links.

---

## Why virtualshell?

- **Persistent session** – reuse modules, `$env:*`, and functions between calls.
- **Low latency** – avoid the 200+ ms penalty of `subprocess.run("pwsh")`; most commands settle in ~2-4 ms.
- **Async + batching** – schedule commands concurrently or in batches with strong timeout control.
- **Structured results** – every invocation returns stdout/stderr, exit code, success flag, and timing.
- **Predictable failures** – typed Python exceptions for “pwsh missing”, timeouts, and execution errors.
- **Type-safe automation** – generate Python `Protocol`s from PowerShell objects and create live proxies with full type hints.

Typical users embed PowerShell inside Python orchestration, long-running agents, or test suites that need reliability and speed.
---

## Installation

```bash
pip install virtualshell
```

Pre-built wheels are published for Windows, Linux (x86_64/aarch64), and macOS universal2. PowerShell (`pwsh` or `powershell.exe`) must be discoverable on `PATH` unless you pass an explicit path.

---

## Quick start

```python
from virtualshell import Shell

with Shell(timeout_seconds=5) as sh:
    result = sh.run("Write-Output 'Hello from pwsh'")
    print(result.out.strip())

    sh.run("function Inc { $global:i++; $global:i }")
    print(sh.run("Inc").out.strip())  # 1
    print(sh.run("Inc").out.strip())  # 2
```

### Async execution

```python
from virtualshell import Shell
import asyncio

async def main():
    shell = Shell().start()
    fut = shell.run_async("Get-Date")
    res = await asyncio.wrap_future(fut)
    print(res.out.strip())
    shell.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```


### Scripts and arguments

```python
from pathlib import Path
from virtualshell import Shell

shell = Shell().start()

# Positional arguments
shell.script(Path("./scripts/test.ps1"), args=["alpha", "42"])

# Named arguments (hashtable splatting)
shell.script(
    Path("./scripts/test.ps1"),
    args={"Name": "Alice", "Count": "3"},
)

shell.stop()
```

Every API surface (sync/async/script) accepts `timeout` overrides and optional error raising via `raise_on_error` or callbacks.

---

## Zero-Copy Bridge (Windows only)

For high-throughput data transfer between Python and PowerShell, the Zero-Copy Bridge uses shared memory to eliminate serialization overhead. Ideal for large binary data, files, or high-frequency transfers.

```python
from virtualshell import Shell, ZeroCopyBridge, PSObject

with Shell(timeout_seconds=60) as shell:
    with ZeroCopyBridge(shell) as bridge:
        # Python → PowerShell
        data = b"Large binary data" * 100000
        bridge.send(data, "$myData", timeout=30.0)
        res = shell.run("$myData.Length")
        print(f"PowerShell received {res.out.strip()} bytes")
    
        # PowerShell → Python
        shell.run("$response = [byte[]]::new(1048576)")
        data = bridge.receive("$response", timeout=30.0)
        print(f"Python received {len(data)} bytes")
```

For more complex scenarios involving PowerShell objects, you can serialize/deserialize them using the built-in methods:

```python
with Shell(timeout_seconds=60) as shell:
    # Get processes from PowerShell
    shell.run("$processes = Get-Process | Select-Object -First 5 -Property Name, Id, WorkingSet64")

    with ZeroCopyBridge(shell) as bridge:
        # Send the process list to Python
        bridge.serialize("processes", out_var="bytes")
        ps_bytes_raw: bytes = bridge.receive("bytes")

        # Convert bytes to PSObject in Python
        ps_obj = PSObject.from_bytes(ps_bytes_raw)

        # Print each process info
        for process in ps_obj["Items"]:
            print(f"Process Name: {process['Name']}, ID: {process['Id']}, Memory: {process['WorkingSet64']} bytes")

        # Modify the process names in Python
        for process in ps_obj["Items"]:
            process["Name"] = f"Modified_{process['Name']}"
        
        # Send modified object back to PowerShell
        bridge.send(ps_obj.to_bytes(), "processes")
        bridge.deserialize("processes")
        
        # Verify changes in PowerShell
        res = shell.run("$processes | Where-Object { $_.Name -like 'Modified_*' }")
        print("\nModified Processes in PowerShell:")
        print(res.out)

```

**Performance:** 5-150 MB/s depending on data size. Requires `win_pwsh.dll` (Windows only).

See [Zero-Copy Bridge guide](wiki/Usage/Zero-Copy%20Bridge.md) for complete documentation.

## PowerShell object proxies

`Shell.generate_psobject` reflects a PowerShell object into a Python `Protocol`, while `Shell.make_proxy` creates a live proxy that forwards attribute access back into PowerShell. Together they give you IDE-friendly, type-hinted automation. This is still an experimental feature and may not cover all edge cases.

```python
from virtualshell import Shell
from StreamWriter import StreamWriter  # generated via Shell().generate_psobject
from StreamReader import StreamReader

with Shell(strip_results=True, timeout_seconds=60) as sh:
    proxy_writer: StreamWriter = sh.make_proxy("StreamWriterProxy", "System.IO.StreamWriter('test.txt')") # type-hinted proxy (StreamWriter made via generate_psobject)

    proxy_writer.WriteLine("Test Line 1!")
    proxy_writer.WriteLine("Test Line 2!")
    proxy_writer.WriteLine("Test Line 3!")
    proxy_writer.Flush()
    proxy_writer.Close()

    proxy_reader: StreamReader = sh.make_proxy("StreamReaderProxy", "System.IO.StreamReader('test.txt')")

    while not proxy_reader.EndOfStream:
        print(f"Read: {proxy_reader.ReadLine()}")
```

Detailed guides live in the wiki: [generate_psobject](wiki/Usage/generate_psobject.md) and [make_proxy](wiki/Usage/make_proxy.md).

## Configuration

```python
from virtualshell import Shell

shell = Shell(
    powershell_path="C:/Program Files/PowerShell/7/pwsh.exe",
    working_directory="C:/automation",
    environment={"MY_FLAG": "1"},
    timeout_seconds=10,
    auto_restart_on_timeout=True,
    stdin_buffer_size=64 * 1024,
    initial_commands=[
        "$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'",
        "$ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'",
    ],
    set_UTF8=True,
    strip_results=False,
)

shell.start()
```

Configuration is applied before the process starts. You can inspect later with `shell._core.get_config()`.
