def legendre_curves(x: torch.Tensor, coefficients: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    r"""Evaluate curves parametrized by Legendre polynomials.

    Args:
        coefficients: A tensor of size :math:`(N, C, D)` of curve coefficients, of a set of :math:`C` polynomial curves
            in :math:`\mathbb{R}^D` of degree :math:`N-1`, represented in the Legendre basis.
        x: Batch of size :math:`(B, C)`, where ``x[:, j]`` is the batch of inputs for the j-th curve in the batch.

    Returns:
        Evaluated points on the curves, shape :math:`(B, C, D)`.

    Note:
        Uses the Clenshaw recursive algorithm, and thus requires :math:`O(N)` time. Implementation is vectorized along
        the :math:`B` and :math:`D` dimensions, but the algorithm requires a loop over the polynomial degree.
