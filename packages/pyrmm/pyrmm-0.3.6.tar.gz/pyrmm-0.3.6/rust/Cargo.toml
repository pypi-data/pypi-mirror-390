[features]
# Feature to enable building Python extension (enables pyo3 features needed for extension)
# Use this feature when building via maturin so the Rust crate is compiled as a Python extension.
# Enable 'macros' so attribute macros like #[pyclass]/#[pymethods]/#[pyfunction] are available.
# Enable 'auto-initialize' to simplify embedding Python (optional but helpful).
