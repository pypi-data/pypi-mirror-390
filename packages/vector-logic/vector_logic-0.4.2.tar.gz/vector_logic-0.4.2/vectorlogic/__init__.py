This package provides a simple rules engine based on state vector representation.
It allows for defining logical rules and performing logical inference.

- Engine: The main interface for creating and managing a rules engine instance.
- StateVector: A core data structure representing a set of logical states.
- TObject: A fundamental building block representing a single row of a state vector.
