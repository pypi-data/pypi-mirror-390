## 🔧 About
**OmnissiahPrayer** is a Python ritual that channels the liturgical invocations of the **Adeptus Mechanicus**. It prints techno-prayers and sacred binary litanies to your console with cinematic typewriter effects and cogitator-approved formatting.

Invoke the Machine Spirit, and let your terminal hum with devotion.

---

## 🧰 Installation

```bash
pip install OmnissiahPrayer
```

Or clone manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CountZeroCode/PraiseTheMachineGod.git
cd PraiseTheMachineGod
pip install .
```

---

## ⚙️ Usage

```python
from OmnissiahPrayer import pray

# Begin your devotional sequence
pray()
```

Each invocation generates a random sacred litany from `holy_words.json`. Occasionally, the Machine Spirit will speak in **binary code (01001000...)**, faster and more intense than mortal speech.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 Cinematic typewriter text effect with randomized delay.
- 🔹 50% chance to activate *Binary Mode* for sacred output.
- 🔹 Glorious ASCII art of the Machine God’s visage.
- 🔹 Fully centered and colorized Adeptus Mechanicus layout.
