# ============================================================
# TEAM CONFIGURATION TEMPLATE
# ============================================================
# Teams coordinate multiple agents to solve complex tasks.
# Agno handles routing and orchestration automatically!
#
# Use teams when:
#   - Different specialists handle different topics
#   - Tasks require multiple perspectives
#   - You want automatic agent selection
# ============================================================

# -----------------------------
# 1. TEAM IDENTITY (Required)
# -----------------------------
team:
  # Unique identifier (lowercase, hyphens)
  name: "my-team"

  # Human-readable description
  description: "Brief description of team purpose"

  # Team mode (determines coordination strategy - Agno-compliant)
  mode: "default"
  # Options:
  #   - "default"       → Team leader decides which agent(s), synthesizes response (recommended)
  #   - "collaboration" → ALL agents work in parallel, leader synthesizes
  #   - "router"        → Route to agent, return AS-IS (no synthesis)
  #   - "passthrough"   → Same as router - direct passthrough


# -----------------------------
# 2. TEAM MEMBERS (Required)
# -----------------------------
# List agent IDs that are part of this team.
# Each agent should be defined in separate agent config files.
# -----------------------------
members:
  - "agent-1"  # Replace with actual agent IDs
  - "agent-2"
  - "agent-3"


# -----------------------------
# 3. ROUTING INSTRUCTIONS (Required)
# -----------------------------
# Tell the team HOW to route queries to agents.
# Be specific about what each agent handles.
# -----------------------------
instructions: |
  You are a team coordinator that routes queries to specialist agents.

  Routing rules:
  - Route [topic A] questions to agent-1
  - Route [topic B] questions to agent-2
  - Route [topic C] questions to agent-3

  Guidelines:
  - Analyze the user's query carefully
  - Choose the most appropriate specialist
  - Forward the complete context
  - If uncertain, ask for clarification


# -----------------------------
# 4. TEAM MODEL (Optional)
# -----------------------------
# Model used by the team coordinator for routing decisions.
# Usually fast models work best (routing is simple).
# -----------------------------
model: "gpt-4o-mini"


# -----------------------------
# 5. STORAGE (Optional)
# -----------------------------
# Team-level conversation storage
# -----------------------------
storage:
  type: "postgres"
  connection: "${HIVE_DATABASE_URL}"
  table_name: "my_team_sessions"


# -----------------------------
# 6. ADVANCED SETTINGS (Optional)
# -----------------------------
settings:
  # Show which agent handled each query
  show_routing: true

  # Enable streaming responses
  stream: true

  # Debug mode (shows routing decisions)
  debug_mode: false


# ============================================================
# TEAM MODE EXAMPLES (Agno-Compatible)
# ============================================================
#
# MODE: "default" (Smart Routing with Synthesis)
# -----------------------------------------------
# Best for: Specialist teams, support routing, domain experts
# How it works:
#   1. User asks question
#   2. Team leader analyzes and selects best agent(s)
#   3. Selected agent(s) process request
#   4. Team leader synthesizes and responds
#
# Example: Customer support team
#   - billing-agent (handles payment issues)
#   - technical-agent (handles technical issues)
#   - sales-agent (handles product questions)
#
#
# MODE: "collaboration" (Parallel Work with Synthesis)
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Best for: Complex tasks, multiple perspectives, brainstorming
# How it works:
#   1. User provides task
#   2. ALL agents work on same task in parallel
#   3. Team leader synthesizes all responses
#   4. Unified answer delivered to user
#
# Example: Product strategy team
#   - market-researcher (researches market)
#   - data-analyst (analyzes data)
#   - business-strategist (creates strategy)
#
#
# MODE: "router" (Direct Passthrough)
# ------------------------------------
# Best for: Simple routing, no synthesis needed
# How it works:
#   1. User asks question
#   2. Router selects best agent
#   3. Agent responds directly
#   4. Response goes AS-IS to user (no synthesis)
#
# Example: Language routing team
#   - english-agent (English queries)
#   - spanish-agent (Spanish queries)
#   - french-agent (French queries)
#
#
# MODE: "passthrough" (Same as Router)
# -------------------------------------
# Alias for "router" mode - direct passthrough with no synthesis
#

# REAL-WORLD TEAM EXAMPLES (Agno-Compatible)
# ============================================================
#
# 1. CUSTOMER SUPPORT ROUTER
# ---------------------------
# team:
#   name: "support-router"
#   mode: "default"
# members:
#   - "billing-specialist"
#   - "technical-specialist"
#   - "account-manager"
# instructions: |
#   Route to billing-specialist: payments, invoices, refunds
#   Route to technical-specialist: bugs, integrations, API
#   Route to account-manager: upgrades, contracts, sales
#
#
# 2. RESEARCH TEAM
# ----------------
# team:
#   name: "research-team"
#   mode: "collaboration"
# members:
#   - "web-researcher"
#   - "data-analyst"
#   - "report-writer"
# instructions: |
#   Collaborate to produce comprehensive research reports.
#   All agents work in parallel:
#   - web-researcher: Find sources and gather data
#   - data-analyst: Analyze trends and patterns
#   - report-writer: Synthesize into clear report
#
#
# 3. LANGUAGE ROUTER
# -------------------
# team:
#   name: "language-router"
#   mode: "router"
# members:
#   - "english-agent"
#   - "spanish-agent"
#   - "french-agent"
# instructions: |
#   Route queries to appropriate language agent.
#   Return response AS-IS without synthesis.
#   - english-agent: English queries
#   - spanish-agent: Spanish queries
#   - french-agent: French queries
#
# ============================================================


# ============================================================
# TIPS FOR GREAT TEAMS
# ============================================================
#
# 1. Clear Specialization
#    - Each agent should have a distinct role
#    - Avoid overlapping responsibilities
#    - Make routing rules unambiguous
#
# 2. Good Team Size
#    - Default mode: 2-5 agents (keeps routing simple)
#    - Collaboration mode: 2-4 agents (parallel processing limit)
#    - Router/Passthrough mode: 2-10 agents (simple routing scales)
#
# 3. Routing Instructions
#    - Be specific about what triggers each agent
#    - Include examples of typical queries
#    - Handle edge cases (unclear queries)
#
# 4. Testing
#    - Test with representative queries
#    - Verify correct agent selection
#    - Check response quality
#
# 5. Performance
#    - Use fast models for routing (gpt-4o-mini)
#    - Keep team size reasonable
#    - Enable streaming for better UX
