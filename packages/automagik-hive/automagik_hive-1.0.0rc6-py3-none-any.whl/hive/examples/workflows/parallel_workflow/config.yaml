  This workflow demonstrates parallel processing for efficiency:

  1. PREPARATION - Set up data sources and parameters
  2. PARALLEL PROCESSING - Process multiple sources simultaneously
     - Source 1: Process independently
     - Source 2: Process independently
     - Source 3: Process independently
  3. AGGREGATION - Merge all parallel results
  4. REPORT - Generate comprehensive report

  Parallel execution significantly reduces total processing time.
