  This workflow executes research tasks in four sequential steps:

  1. PLANNING - Understand the topic and create a structured research plan
  2. RESEARCH - Gather information from available sources
  3. ANALYSIS - Process and analyze the collected data
  4. SUMMARY - Generate a comprehensive summary with key findings

  Each step builds on the previous one, passing state forward.
