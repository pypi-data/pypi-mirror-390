Ready to code? Awesome! Here's how to get started.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- PostgreSQL 16+ (for testing knowledge features)
- Git
- UV (recommended) or pip

### Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/automagik-hive.git
cd automagik-hive

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync

# Or with pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# 4. Run tests to verify setup
uv run pytest

# 5. Start development server
make dev
```

## 📋 Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes

### 2. Make Your Changes

**Key principles:**
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Write or update tests for your changes
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

**Code style:**
```bash
# Run linting
uv run ruff check --fix

# Run type checking
uv run mypy .

# Format code
uv run ruff format
```

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test files
uv run pytest tests/ai/agents/

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=ai --cov=api --cov=lib

# Test your changes manually
make dev  # Start server and verify functionality
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions or changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(agents): add support for streaming responses"
git commit -m "fix(knowledge): resolve CSV hot reload race condition"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Key Patterns

**YAML-First Configuration:**
```yaml
# ai/agents/my-agent/config.yaml
agent:
  name: "My Agent"
  id: "my-agent"
  version: "1.0.0"

model:
  provider: "anthropic"
  id: "claude-sonnet-4"

instructions: |
  Agent instructions here
```

**Agent Factory Pattern:**
```python
# ai/agents/my-agent/agent.py
def get_my_agent(**kwargs) -> Agent:
    config = yaml.safe_load(open("config.yaml"))
    return Agent.from_yaml("config.yaml", **kwargs)
```

**Testing Pattern:**
```python
# tests/ai/agents/test_my_agent.py
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_agent(mock_env_vars):
    agent = await get_agent("my-agent")
    assert agent.id == "my-agent"
```
