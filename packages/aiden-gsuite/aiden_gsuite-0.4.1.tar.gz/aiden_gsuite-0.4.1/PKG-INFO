## Quickstart

### Install

No credential file needed with [Aiden](https://github.com/AllWiseAI/aiden-chat).

```json
"aiden-gsuite": {
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": [
    "aiden-gsuite@0.4.1"
  ],
  "env": {
    "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": ""
  },
  "aiden_credential": {
    "type": "oauth",
    "service": "google",
    "scopes": [
      "openid",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.compose",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file"
    ]
  },
  "transport": "stdio"
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers run over stdio, debugging can be challenging. For the best debugging
experience, we strongly recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector).

You can launch the MCP Inspector via [ `npm` ](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with this command:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv --directory /path/to/aiden-gsuite run aiden-gsuite
```

Upon launching, the Inspector will display a URL that you can access in your browser to begin debugging.
