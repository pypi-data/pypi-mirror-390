# Python_undef

This is a Python script that generates a header file "Python_undef.h" which undefine many macros in "pyconfig.h" that doesn't match the rule that "should start with PY_".

## Why

The "pyconfig.h" continue many macros that doesn't math the rule that "should start with PY_" which may cause the comflict with the other projects. This project undefines them.

## Download

```bash
pip install python_undef
```

## Usage

This command will create the file "Python_undef.h"

```bash
python -m python_undef --generate
```

This command will output the include path of "Python_undef.h".

You can use this command in your C/C++ project such as "cmake", "gyp" and so on.

```bash
python -m python_undef --include
```

You can include the "Python_undef.h" file in your project:

```c
#include <Python.h>
#include <Python_undef.h>
#include <other_header.h>
```

The "pyconfig.h" continue many macros that doesn't math the rule that "should start with PY_". This file undefine them.

If you want to save the macro, use `#define DONOTUNDEF_macro_name` before include "Python_undef.h" to keep it.
