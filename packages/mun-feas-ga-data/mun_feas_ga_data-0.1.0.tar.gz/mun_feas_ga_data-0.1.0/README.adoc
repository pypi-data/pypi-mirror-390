= GAD: GA Data tool

== Development

To hack on GAD, install
https://www.python.org/downloads[Python] and
https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation[Poetry],
check out this repository and then run
`poetry install`.
By default, this will install GAD in editable mode: make changes to the code and they
will be immediately reflected when you next run `gad`.
