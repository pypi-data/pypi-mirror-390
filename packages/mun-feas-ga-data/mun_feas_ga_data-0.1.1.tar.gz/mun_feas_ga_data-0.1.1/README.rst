GAD: GA Data tool
=================

Development
===========

To hack on GAD, install
`Python <https://www.python.org/downloads>`_
and
`Poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`_,
check out this repository and then run
`poetry install`.
By default, this will install GAD in editable mode: make changes to the code and they
will be immediately reflected when you next run `gad`.
