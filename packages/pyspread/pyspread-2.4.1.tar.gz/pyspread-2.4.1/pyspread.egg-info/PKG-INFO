# Installation

It is recommended to install pyspread as a package that is provided for your operating system. The table below shows for which operating systems, pyspread is available in which version.

![Packaged](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/pyspread.svg?header&columns=4)

If pyspread is unavailable or outdated for your operating system, you can install it using one of the three methods below.

When using pip, a Python virtual environment (venv) is recommended. Some operating systems may nudge your towards this. pipx could be a solution if venv is no option for you.

Furthermore, note that the QtSvg extensions for PyQT are required. For some operating systems, they are packaged separately from PyQt. Please make sure QtSvg is installed on your system before using pip.

### With pip

```bash
pip install pyspread
```

### From git

It is assumed that python3 and git are installed.

**Get sources and enter dir**
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread.git
# or
git clone git@gitlab.com:pyspread/pyspread.git
# then
cd pyspread
```

**Install dependencies and pyspread**
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# or if pip3 is not present
pip install -r requirements.txt
# next
python3 setup.py install
```

## Getting the bleeding edge version from the code repository

Note that there may unfixed bugs if you use the latest repository version.
You may want to check the CI, which comprises unit tests at
`https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread/pipelines`.

Get the latest tarball or zip at https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread or
clone the git repo at `https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread.git`

# Starting pyspread

```
inside the top directory.
