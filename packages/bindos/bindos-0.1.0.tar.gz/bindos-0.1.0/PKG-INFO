# BindOS

BindOS is a small library and CLI that flattens the curvature of numeric time series.
It was born from quantum experiments where it turned noisy fidelity trajectories into almost geodesic curves.

## Install

BindOS is in local development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .

from bindos.core import stabilize

series = [0.8, 0.82, 0.79, 0.81]
res = stabilize(series, steps=10, alpha=0.5)
print("Initial curvature:", res["curvature_initial"])
print("Stabilized curvature:", res["curvature_stabilized"])

Initial curvature: {'mean': 5.55e-17, 'std': 0.05, 'max': 0.05, 'min': -0.05, 'n': 2}
Stabilized curvature: {'mean': 0.0, 'std': 4.88e-05, 'max': 4.88e-05, 'min': -4.88e-05, 'n': 2}
