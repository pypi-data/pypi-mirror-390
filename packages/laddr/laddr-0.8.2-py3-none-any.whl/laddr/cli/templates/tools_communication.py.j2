Communication and collaboration tools for agents.

NOTE: Delegation tools are automatically provided by the agent runtime as system tools:
  - system_delegate_task: Delegate a single task to another agent
  - system_delegate_parallel: Delegate multiple tasks in parallel
  - system_split_document: Split large documents for parallel processing

These tools are available to ALL agents automatically. You don't need to define them here.

This file is for custom communication/collaboration tools specific to your project.
