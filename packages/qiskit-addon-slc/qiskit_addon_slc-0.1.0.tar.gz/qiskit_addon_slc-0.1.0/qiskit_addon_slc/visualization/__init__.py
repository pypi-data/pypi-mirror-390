    First, the provided ``bounds`` are accumulated and filtered according to ``pauli_filter``. See

    Then, the resulting bounds are overlaid onto the provided ``circuit`` (see
    :func:`.overlay_bounds_onto_circuit`) and subsequently rendered (see :func:`.render_bounds`).

    Args:
        circuit: the circuit whose shaded lightcone to draw.
        bounds: the bounds to use for the shaded lightcone.
        noise_model_paulis: the Pauli error terms of the circuit's noise models.
        pauli_filter: the optional Pauli type by which the bounds were filtered.
        include_empty_boxes: whether to include empty boxes or not.
        rendering_kwargs: any additional keyword arguments are forwarded to
