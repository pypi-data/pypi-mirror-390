    A["find a website that looks cool"] --> B["you give it the URL"]
    B --> C["the AI clones it"]
    C -- The cloning looks good --> D["AI creates a style.md file teaching your agents how to create pages in that exact same style"]
    D --> E["you make changes in the style.md file so it has your personality"]
    E --> F["🎉 Now your AI agents can generate consistently generate beautiful pages!"]
    C -- It looks ass --> G["you keep refining the prompt until it looks nice"]
    G -- It still doesn't look nice --> H["You either"]
    H --> I["try another website"] & J["cry"]
