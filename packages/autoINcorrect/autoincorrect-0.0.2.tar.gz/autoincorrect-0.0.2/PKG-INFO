autoINcorrect 🤖💥

"A spell-checker-in-reverse"

Ever stared at your phone, absolutely convinced you typed "meeting," only for it to send "meating"? We've all been victims of autocorrect. But it got me thinking: what if we turned the tables?

This is the autoINcorrect system. It's a "spell-checker-in-reverse" that, instead of fixing mistakes, artfully creates them.

The Idea

This isn't just random chaos. It's a sophisticated system built on a simple, but (if I do say so myself) pretty smart idea: what if, to test how good a "fixer" is, we first built the perfect "breaker"?

By simulating how humans make real, plausible errors, we can build the ultimate stress-test for any real autocorrect model out there. It's an entire NLP pipeline, built in reverse.

This system understands:

Physical Errors: Simulating "fat-finger" slips from an actual keyboard layout.

Cognitive Errors: Simulating "brain-fart" moments like homophone swaps (your vs. you're).

Semantic Errors: Simulating "near-miss" malapropisms like banking -> banker using NLP (NLTK) and word embeddings (GloVe).

Formatting Errors: Simulating real-world punctuation mistakes and random case-flipping.

📦 First-Time Setup

Before you run the script, you'll need the necessary NLP models. Your pipeline.py file includes a helper function to do this automatically.

The first time you import or run the package, it will:

Check for the necessary nltk data (WordNet, Punkt, Tagger).

Download any missing nltk packages.

The first time you use the "Malapropism" module, it will download the glove-wiki-gigaword-100 model (this may take a minute).

🚀 Quick Start & Usage

This package is designed to be simple to use and easy to chain. The main wrapper function is auto_incorrect().

# --- Import the main functions ---
from autoINcorrect import auto_incorrect, word_error, corrupt_format

my_text = "I am running a test on my banking application for its creative standards. It's a beautiful day to see if your function works correctly."

# --- Option 1: Run the full chain with one function ---
# (This uses all default settings)

print("--- Full Corruption (Default) ---")
# This is the main wrapper function you'll usually use
corrupted_text = auto_incorrect(my_text)
print(corrupted_text)


# --- Option 2: Manually chain functions for more control ---

print("\n--- Manual Chaining (Custom Settings) ---")

# 1. Apply word-based errors
# (Let's make errors common, with 70% typos and 30% smart errors)
custom_distribution = {
    'fat_finger': 0.7, 
    'brain_fart': 0.3, 
    'malapropism': 0.0
}
text_with_word_errors = word_error(
    my_text, 
    error_rate=0.3, # Corrupt 30% of words
    distribution=custom_distribution
)

# 2. Apply punctuation and case errors to that result
# (Let's be aggressive: remove all punctuation and flip 80% of caps)
final_corrupted_text = corrupt_format(
    text_with_word_errors,
    add_rate=0.0,
    replace_rate=0.0,
    remove_rate=1.0,         # 100% chance to remove punctuation
    case_corruption_prob=0.8 # 80% chance to flip a CAPITAL
)

print(f"\nOriginal:\n{my_text}\n")
print(f"Corrupted:\n{final_corrupted_text}")


🛠️ Key Modules

Your package is split into two main corruption functions, which are combined in the auto_incorrect() wrapper.

1. word_error()

This function handles all word-based corruption. It contains three sub-modules:

⌨️ "Fat Finger" Module: Simulates physical keyboard mistakes.

adjacent_swap: standard -> stamdard (m near n)

transpose: standard -> standrad

delete_char: standard -> standad

insert_char: standard -> standfard

🧠 "Brain Fart" Module: Simulates cognitive "word choice" mistakes.

replace_homophone: your -> you're

replace_morphological: decision -> decide (uses NLTK/WordNet)

🎭 "Malapropism" Module: The smartest module. Creates "near-miss" semantic errors.

replace_semantic_neighbor: banking -> banker (uses GloVe embeddings to find related words with the same root).

2. corrupt_format()

This function handles all punctuation and case-based corruption.

Punctuation: Randomly adds (word,), removes (word. -> word), or replaces (word? -> word;) punctuation marks.

Case: Randomly flips CAPITAL letters to lowercase based on a probability.

📦 Installation
