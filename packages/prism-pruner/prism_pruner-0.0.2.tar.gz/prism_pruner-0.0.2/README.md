PRISM (PRuning Interface for Similar Molecules) is the modular similarity pruning code from [FIRECODE](https://github.com/ntampellini/FIRECODE/tree/main), in a standalone package. It filters out duplicate structures from conformational ensembles, leaving behind non-redundant states.

The code implements a cached, iterative, divide-and conquer approach on increasingly large subsets of the ensemble and removes duplicates as assessed by one of three metrics:
- Heavy-atom RMSD and maximum deviation
- Rotamer-corrected heavy-atom RMSD and maximum deviation
- Relative deviation of the moments of inertia on the principal axes
