## Single-File Analysis (Asynchronous Version)

* **Automatic Content Type Detection**: Automatically recognizes PDF, TIFF, PNG, and JPEG formats and processes them in the optimal way.
* **Page Splitting and Asynchronous Parallel Processing**: Automatically splits multi-page PDFs and TIFFs into individual pages and performs inference in parallel.
* **Timeout Management**: Equipped with timeout control and automatic retry mechanisms.
* **Circuit Breaker Mechanism**: Temporarily halts requests to protect the endpoint when consecutive failures occur.

```python
import asyncio
from yomitoku_client import YomitokuClient
from yomitoku_client import parse_pydantic_model

ENDPOINT_NAME = "my-endpoint"
AWS_REGION = "ap-northeast-1"

target_file = "notebooks/sample/image.pdf"

async def main():
    async with YomitokuClient(
        endpoint=ENDPOINT_NAME,
        region=AWS_REGION,
    ) as client:
        result = await client.analyze_async(target_file)

    # Format conversion
    model = parse_pydantic_model(result)
    model.to_csv(output_path="output.csv")     # Save as CSV
    model.to_markdown(output_path="output.md", image_path=target_file)  # Save as Markdown
    model.to_json(output_path='output.json', mode="separate")  # Save per-page (mode="separate")
    model.to_html(output_path='output.html', image_path=target_file, page_index=[0, 2])  # Specify output pages
    model.to_pdf(output_path='output.pdf', image_path=target_file)  # Generate searchable PDF

    # Visualization of OCR results
    model.visualize(
        image_path=target_file,
        mode='ocr',
        page_index=None,
        output_directory="demo",
    )

    # Visualization of layout analysis results
    model.visualize(
        image_path=target_file,
        mode='layout',
        page_index=None,
        output_directory="demo",
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Batch-Processing Capabilities

YomitokuClient also supports batch processing, enabling safe and efficient handling of large numbers of documents.

* **Folder-level batch processing**: Automatically detects PDF/image files in a specified directory and executes parallel processing.
* **Intermediate log output (`process_log.jsonl`)**: Records each file’s processing result, success/failure, processing time, and error details as one JSON line per record (useful for downstream processing or retry workflows).
* **Overwrite control**: Skip files already processed (`overwrite=False`) to improve efficiency.
* **Retry support**: Easy to reprocess only failed files based on the log output.
* **Post-processing using logs**: Read `process_log.jsonl` and automatically export Markdown or visualization output for only the successful files.

### Sample Code

```python
import asyncio
import json
import os

from yomitoku_client import YomitokuClient
from yomitoku_client import parse_pydantic_model

# I/O settings
target_dir = "notebooks/sample"
outdir = "output"

# SageMaker endpoint settings
ENDPOINT_NAME = "my-endpoint"
AWS_REGION = "ap-northeast-1"

async def main():
    # Run batch analysis
    async with YomitokuClient(
        endpoint=ENDPOINT_NAME,
        region=AWS_REGION,
    ) as client:
        await client.analyze_batch_async(
            input_dir=target_dir,
            output_dir=outdir,
        )

    # Process only successful files from the log
    with open(os.path.join(outdir, "process_log.jsonl"), "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
        logs = [json.loads(line) for line in f if line.strip()]

    out_markdown = os.path.join(outdir, "markdown")
    out_visualize = os.path.join(outdir, "visualization")

    os.makedirs(out_markdown, exist_ok=True)
    os.makedirs(out_visualize, exist_ok=True)

    for log in logs:
        if not log.get("success"):
            continue

        with open(log["output_path"], "r", encoding="utf-8") as rf:
            result = json.load(rf)

        doc = parse_pydantic_model(result)

        base = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(log["file_path"]))[0]
        doc.to_markdown(output_path=os.path.join(out_markdown, f"{base}.md"))

        doc.visualize(
            image_path=log["file_path"],
            mode="ocr",
            output_directory=out_visualize,
            dpi=log.get("dpi", 200),
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
