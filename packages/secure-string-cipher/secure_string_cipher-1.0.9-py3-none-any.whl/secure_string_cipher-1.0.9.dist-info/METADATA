A simple, secure AES-256-GCM encryption tool with an interactive menu interface.

**Requirements:** Python 3.10+

## Features

- **Encrypt/Decrypt** text and files using AES-256-GCM
- **Passphrase Generator** with entropy calculation
- **Encrypted Vault** to store your passphrases
- Streams large files in chunks (low memory usage)
- Text mode outputs Base64 for easy copy/paste
- Optional clipboard integration

## Installation

```bash
# Recommended: install with pipx
pipx install secure-string-cipher

# Or with pip
pip install secure-string-cipher

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
pip install .
```

## Usage

Just run:

```bash
cipher-start
```

You'll see a menu:

```
Available Operations:
  1. Encrypt text          - Encrypt a message (returns base64 string)
  2. Decrypt text          - Decrypt a base64 encrypted message
  3. Encrypt file          - Encrypt a file (creates .enc file)
  4. Decrypt file          - Decrypt an encrypted file
  5. Generate passphrase   - Create a secure random passphrase
  6. Exit                  - Quit the program
```

Pick an option and follow the prompts.

## Docker

Use the pre-built image:

```bash
# Pull and run
docker pull ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest

# Or with docker-compose
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
docker-compose run --rm cipher
```

To encrypt files in your current directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/data" \
  ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
```

With persistent passphrase vault:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/data" \
  -v cipher-vault:/home/cipheruser/.secure-cipher \
  ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
```

**Image specs:** 78MB, Alpine-based, runs as non-root, 0 critical/high/medium vulnerabilities.

## Security

- **Algorithm:** AES-256-GCM
- **Key derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (390,000 iterations)
- **Passphrase vault:** AES-256-GCM encrypted with master password
- **File permissions:** Vault restricted to user-only

## Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Auto-format code before committing
make format

# Run all checks (format + lint + test)
make ci
```

### Available Commands

```bash
make format      # Auto-format with Ruff
make lint        # Check formatting, types, and code quality
make test        # Run tests
make test-cov    # Run tests with coverage report
make clean       # Remove temporary files
make ci          # Run full CI pipeline locally
```

### Code Quality Tools

- **Ruff**: Ultra-fast all-in-one tool that replaces Black, isort, flake8, and more
- **mypy**: Static type checker (catches type errors)
- **pytest**: Testing framework

**Before pushing**, run `make format` to auto-fix all issues, then `make ci` to verify everything passes.
