A simple, secure AES-256-GCM encryption tool with an interactive menu interface.

**Developed for:** Python 3.14  
**Backward compatible to:** Python 3.10+

## Features

- Encrypt and decrypt text and files with AES-256-GCM
- Generate strong random passphrases with entropy calculation
- Store passphrases in an encrypted vault (optional)
  - HMAC-SHA256 integrity verification to detect tampering
  - Automatic backup creation (keeps last 5 backups)
  - Atomic writes to prevent corruption
- Stream large files in chunks for low memory usage
- Text output in Base64 for easy copy/paste
- Clipboard integration available

## Installation

> **Note**: This project is developed for **Python 3.14** (latest stable) and is backward compatible to Python 3.10+. We follow Python's official support policy and may drop support for older versions as they reach end-of-life.

```bash
# Recommended: install with pipx
pipx install secure-string-cipher

# Or with pip
pip install secure-string-cipher

# Or from source
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
pip install .
```

## Usage

Run the interactive CLI:

```bash
cipher-start
```

You'll see this menu:

## Docker

Use the pre-built image (Python 3.14-alpine based):

```bash
# Pull and run
docker pull ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest

# Or with Docker Compose
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
docker compose run --rm cipher
```

To encrypt files in your current directory:

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/data" \
  ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
```

With persistent passphrase vault (including backups):

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$PWD:/data" \
  -v cipher-vault:/home/cipheruser/.secure-cipher \
  ghcr.io/theredtower/secure-string-cipher:latest
```

**Image details:** ~78MB Alpine-based image, Python 3.14, runs as non-root user (UID 1000), includes HMAC integrity verification and automatic backups.

## Security

- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM with authenticated encryption
- **Key derivation:** PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (390,000 iterations)
- **Passphrase vault:** Encrypted with AES-256-GCM using your master password
- **Vault integrity:** HMAC-SHA256 verification detects file tampering
- **Automatic backups:** Last 5 vault backups saved in `~/.secure-cipher/backups/`
- **File permissions:** Vault files are user-only (chmod 600)
- **Password requirements:** Minimum 12 characters with complexity checks

## Development

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install with dev dependencies
git clone https://github.com/TheRedTower/secure-string-cipher.git
cd secure-string-cipher
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Format code before committing
make format

# Run the full test suite
make ci
```

### Available Commands

```bash
make format      # Auto-format code with Ruff
make lint        # Check formatting, types, and code quality
make test        # Run test suite
make test-cov    # Run tests with coverage report
make clean       # Remove temporary files
make ci          # Run complete CI pipeline locally
```

### Tools

- **Ruff** – Fast linter and formatter (replaces Black, isort, flake8)
- **mypy** – Static type checking
- **pytest** – Testing framework with 150+ tests

Run `make format` before pushing, then `make ci` to verify everything passes.
