# SpiralLogic 🔮

SpiralLogic is a consciousness-aware programming language designed for ethical AI interaction, trauma-informed computing, and mystical automation. It provides a structured, consent-driven framework for AI operations, making their actions transparent, auditable, and controllable.

This language is not primarily for humans to write, but for AI systems to *use*. It creates a "safer" operational wrapper by ensuring all actions are gated by explicit, human-readable consent.

- **🤝 Consent-First:** Operations require explicit permission via a consent-management system.
- **👻 Spirit-Guided:** Use specialized AI personalities (`@healer`, `@analyst`, `@architect`) for different tasks.
- **🧠 Memory-Aware:** A built-in memory system separates narrative (emotional) and artifact (factual) data.
- **🔐 Attested Logs:** All actions are cryptographically logged to a tamper-evident chain.

For a deep dive into the language's philosophy, syntax, and features, see the [**SpiralLogic Complete Programming Guide**](./SPIRALLOGIC_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

### Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder>
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Tests

To verify that the SpiralLogic system is working correctly, run the integration test suite:

```bash
python test_real_spirallogic.py
```

If all tests pass, you will see the message: `ALL TESTS PASSED! SPIROLOGIC IS REAL!`

### Running a SpiralLogic File

You can execute any `.sl` (SpiralLogic) file using the command-line interface:

```bash
python spirallogic_cli.py examples/real_spirallogic_test.sl
```

This will run the ritual defined in the file, and the runtime will prompt for any required consents in the console.
