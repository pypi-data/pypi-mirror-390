This folder contains everything needed to package and publish `tools/browser_service` as a standalone PyPI package.

## 🎯 Goal

Transform `tools/browser_service` into `browser-service` package that can be installed via:
```bash
pip install browser-service
```

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Read the overview**: Open `SUMMARY.md`
2. **Follow the checklist**: Work through `CHECKLIST.md`
3. **Get detailed help**: Reference `PUBLISHING_GUIDE.md` as needed
4. **After publishing**: Use `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` to update this project

## 🚀 Three-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare
```powershell
# Clone your new GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/browser-service.git

# Copy files using the script
.\packaging\copy_to_new_repo.ps1

# Or copy manually
# (see SUMMARY.md for details)
```

### Step 2: Publish
```powershell
# In your new repository
cd path\to\browser-service

# Update metadata in setup.py, pyproject.toml, README.md

# Build
python -m build

# Test on TestPyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Publish to PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

### Step 3: Migrate
```powershell
# Back in this project
cd C:\Users\Devasy\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\Natural-Language-to-Robot-Framework

# Install the published package
pip install browser-service

# Update requirements.txt
# Add: browser-service>=1.0.0
