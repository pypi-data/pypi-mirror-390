"""PubSubSolo class for scoped singleton PubSub instances.

This module implements the PubSubSolo class, which provides scoped singleton
instances of PubSub. Each scope (e.g., package/library name) gets its own
singleton instance, enabling multiple packages to have their own singletons
that can be aggregated via PubSubAggregator.

Domains:
    - pubsub
    - pubsub-solo

    """Thread-safe scoped singleton wrapper for PubSub instances.

    Ensures only one PubSub instance exists per scope name. Each package/library
    can have its own singleton instance by using a unique scope name.

    Thread-Safety:
        Instance creation is protected by a lock to ensure thread-safe
        singleton initialization per scope.

    Scoping:
        Each scope name gets its own singleton instance. This allows multiple
        packages/libraries to each have their own singleton while still
        enabling aggregation via PubSubAggregator.

    Example:
        # In package_a/__init__.py
        >>> from splurge_pub_sub import PubSubSolo
        >>> bus_a = PubSubSolo.get_instance(scope="package_a")
