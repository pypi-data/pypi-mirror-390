                occurrence will be ignored until the offset is satisfied
                True - the first trigger occurrence will be used despite

        fileName (str): the desired name of file. If you do not specify
            this parameter, the captured data will not be written at all.

                and cff (COMTRADE).

        executeAt (int, float): executes this command at a specified
            simulation time. If ``executeAt`` is not specified
            (or ``executeAt`` == None) the command will be executed
            immediately.
        timeout (int): Starts a counter to abort the capture process
            after n seconds. When not defined, the timeout will be inf.
        timeFormat (str): Select time format returned in ``timeData`` . By default
