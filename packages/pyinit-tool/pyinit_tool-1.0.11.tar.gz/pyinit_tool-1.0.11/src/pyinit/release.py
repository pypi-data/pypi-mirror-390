"""
Implements the 'release' command for the pyinit command-line tool.

This module is responsible for programmatically incrementing the project's
version number according to Semantic Versioning (SemVer) rules. It reads the
current version, increments the specified part (major, minor, or patch), and
writes the new version back to both `pyproject.toml` and the package's
`__init__.py` file.
