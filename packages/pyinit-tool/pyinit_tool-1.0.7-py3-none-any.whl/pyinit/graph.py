Implements the 'graph' command for the pyinit command-line tool.

This module provides a convenient way to visualize the project's dependency
tree. It uses the 'pipdeptree' package to generate and display a hierarchical
view of installed packages and their sub-dependencies, which is invaluable
for debugging dependency conflicts.
