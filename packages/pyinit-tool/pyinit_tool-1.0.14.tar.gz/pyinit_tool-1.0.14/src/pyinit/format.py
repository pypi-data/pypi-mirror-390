"""
Implements the 'format' command for the pyinit command-line tool.

This module provides a convenient wrapper around standard Python code formatters,
'isort' for sorting imports and 'black' for opinionated code formatting.
It automates the installation of these tools and runs them against the
project's 'src/' and 'tests/' directories to ensure a consistent code style.

    Formats the project's codebase using isort and black.

    This function serves as the main entry point for the 'pyinit format' command.

    1. Verifies the project context and virtual environment.
    2. Checks if 'isort' and 'black' are installed in the venv, installing
       them if necessary.
