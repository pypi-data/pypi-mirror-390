Implements the 'test' command for the pyinit command-line tool.

This module provides a convenient wrapper for running tests using the 'pytest'
framework. It handles the automatic installation of pytest if it is not found
and allows for passing additional arguments directly to the pytest runner.

    Runs the project's tests using pytest.

    This function serves as the main entry point for the 'pyinit test' command.
    It performs the following steps:
    1. Verifies the project context and virtual environment.
    2. Checks if a 'tests/' directory exists (unless specific test files are
       passed as arguments).
    3. Ensures pytest is installed in the virtual environment, installing it
       if necessary.
    4. Executes pytest, passing along any user-provided arguments.
