# PicoContainer API Reference

This page lists the public methods of the PicoContainer class and the top-level init() function.

---

## init() Function

This is the main entry point for creating and configuring a container.

```python
import logging
from typing import Any, Iterable, Optional, Dict, Tuple, List, Union
from pico_ioc import PicoContainer, ContainerObserver
from pico_ioc.config_builder import ContextConfig

KeyT = Union[str, type]

def init(
    modules: Union[Any, Iterable[Any]],
    *,
    profiles: Tuple[str, ...] = (),
    allowed_profiles: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None,
    environ: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
    overrides: Optional[Dict[KeyT, Any]] = None,
    logger: Optional[logging.Logger] = None,
    config: Optional[ContextConfig] = None,
    custom_scopes: Optional[Iterable[str]] = None,
    validate_only: bool = False,
    container_id: Optional[str] = None,
    observers: Optional[List[ContainerObserver]] = None
) -> PicoContainer: ...
```

- modules: A module, package, or an iterable of modules/package names (strings) to scan for components.
- profiles: A tuple of active profile names (e.g., "prod", "test"). Used by conditional decorators.
- allowed_profiles: Optional. If set, raises ConfigurationError if any profile in profiles is not in this list.
- environ: Optional. A dictionary to use instead of os.environ. Useful for testing conditionals.
- overrides: Optional. A dictionary mapping Keys to specific instances or provider functions, replacing any discovered components for those keys. Used primarily for testing.
- logger: Optional. A custom logger instance. Defaults to pico_ioc.LOGGER.
- config: Optional. A ContextConfig object created by the configuration(...) builder. Encapsulates configuration sources (environment variables, files, dictionaries), overrides, and rules for mapping them to @configured classes.
- custom_scopes: Optional. An iterable of custom scope names (strings) to register. Pico IOC will automatically create ContextVar-backed scope implementations for these names.
- validate_only: Default False. If True, performs all scanning and validation steps but returns a container without creating instances or running lifecycle methods. Useful for quick startup checks.
- container_id: Optional. A specific ID string to assign to this container. If None, a unique ID is automatically generated.
- observers: Optional. A list of objects implementing the ContainerObserver protocol. Observers receive events such as on_resolve and on_cache_hit for monitoring and tracing.
- Returns: A configured PicoContainer instance ready to resolve components.

## PicoContainer Instance Methods

### get(key: KeyT) -> Any

Synchronously retrieves or creates a component instance for the given Key. Raises ProviderNotFoundError or ComponentCreationError. Instances are cached according to scope.

- key: The class type or string name of the component to retrieve.
- Returns: The component instance.

---

### aget(key: KeyT) -> Any

Asynchronously retrieves or creates a component instance for the given Key. Correctly handles async def providers and __ainit__ methods. Raises ProviderNotFoundError or ComponentCreationError. Instances are cached according to scope.

- key: The class type or string name of the component to retrieve.
- Returns: The component instance (awaitable).

---

### has(key: KeyT) -> bool

Checks if a provider is registered for the given Key or if an instance exists in the cache for the current scope.

- key: The class type or string name to check.
- Returns: True if the key can be resolved, False otherwise.

---

### activate() -> contextvars.Token

Manually activates this container in the current context. Returns a token needed for deactivate(). Prefer using with container.as_current():.

- Returns: A contextvars.Token for restoring the context.

---

### deactivate(token: contextvars.Token) -> None

Manually deactivates this container, restoring the previous context using the token from activate().

- token: The token returned by activate().

---

### as_current() -> ContextManager[PicoContainer]

Returns a context manager (with container.as_current(): ...) that activates this container for the duration of the with block. This is the preferred way to manage the Container Context.

- Yields: The container instance (self).

---

### activate_scope(name: str, scope_id: Any) -> Optional[contextvars.Token]

Activates a specific Scope (e.g., "request") with a given ID. Returns a token if the scope uses contextvars. Prefer with container.scope():.

- name: The name of the scope to activate (e.g., "request").
- scope_id: A unique identifier for this instance of the scope (e.g., a request ID string).
- Returns: An optional contextvars.Token.

---

### deactivate_scope(name: str, token: Optional[contextvars.Token]) -> None

Deactivates a specific Scope using the token returned by activate_scope.

- name: The name of the scope to deactivate.
- token: The token returned by activate_scope.

---

### scope(name: str, scope_id: Any) -> ContextManager[PicoContainer]

Returns a context manager (with container.scope("request", "id-123"): ...) that activates a specific Scope for the duration of the with block. This is the preferred way to manage scopes like "request".

- name: The name of the scope to activate.
- scope_id: A unique identifier for this scope instance.
- Yields: The container instance (self).

---

### cleanup_all() -> None

Synchronously calls all methods decorated with @cleanup on all cached singleton and scoped components managed by this container.

---

### cleanup_all_async() -> Awaitable[None]

Asynchronously calls all methods decorated with @cleanup (including async def methods) on all cached components.

- Returns: An awaitable.

---

### shutdown() -> None

Performs a full shutdown:
1. Calls cleanup_all().
2. Removes the container from the global registry (making it inaccessible via PicoContainer.get_current() or all_containers()).

---

### stats() -> Dict[str, Any]

Returns a dictionary containing runtime statistics and metrics about the container (e.g., uptime, resolve counts, cache hit rate).

- Returns: A dictionary of stats.

---

### health_check() -> Dict[str, bool]

Executes all methods decorated with @health on cached components and returns a status report. Methods raising exceptions are reported as False (unhealthy).

- Returns: A dictionary mapping 'ClassName.method_name' to a boolean health status.

---

### export_graph(path: str, *, include_scopes: bool = True, include_qualifiers: bool = False, rankdir: str = "LR", title: Optional[str] = None) -> None

Exports the container's component dependency graph to a .dot file (Graphviz format) for visualization. Note: This method generates the .dot file content; rendering it requires the Graphviz tool.

- path: The full path (including filename, typically with a .dot extension) where the graph file will be saved.
- include_scopes: Default True. If True, adds scope information (e.g., [scope=request]) to the node labels.
- include_qualifiers: Default False. If True, adds qualifier information (e.g., \n⟨q⟩) to the node labels.
- rankdir: Default "LR". Sets the layout direction for Graphviz (e.g., "LR" for Left-to-Right, "TB" for Top-to-Bottom).
- title: Optional. A title string to display at the top of the graph.
- Returns: None.

---

## PicoContainer Class Attributes / Methods (Static)

### get_current() -> Optional[PicoContainer]

(Class method) Returns the PicoContainer instance currently active in this context (set via as_current() or activate()), or None if no container is active.

- Returns: The active PicoContainer or None.

---

### get_current_id() -> Optional[str]

(Class method) Returns the container_id of the currently active container, or None.

- Returns: The active container's ID string or None.

---

### all_containers() -> Dict[str, PicoContainer]

(Class method) Returns a dictionary mapping all currently active (not shut down) container IDs to their PicoContainer instances.

- Returns: A dictionary of all registered containers.

---

## Notes

- Keys: A Key identifies a component and is typically a class or a string alias. The KeyT type in signatures is Union[str, type].
- Scopes: Components can be singleton, request-scoped, or belong to custom scopes you register via init(custom_scopes=...).
- Lifecycle: Decorate methods with @cleanup to have them called during cleanup; use @health for health checks.
- Observability: Register observers via init(..., observers=[...]) to receive events (e.g., on_resolve, on_cache_hit) for monitoring.
