HILO-MPC is a Python toolbox for **easy, flexible and fast realization of machine-learning-supported optimal control, and 
estimation problems** developed mainly at the [Control and Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, TU Darmstadt](https://www.ccps.tu-darmstadt.de), and the [Laboratory for Systems Theory and Control, Otto von Guericke University](http://ifatwww.et.uni-magdeburg.de/syst/). It can be used for model predictive control, moving horizon estimation, Kalman filters, solving optimal control problems and has interfaces to embedded model predictive control tools.

HILO-MPC can interface directly to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
to create machine learning models and the [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) framework to efficiently
build control and estimation problems. The machine learning models can be used (almost) everywhere in the setup
of these problems.

Currently the following machine learning models are supported:

- Feedforward neural networks
- Gaussian processes
 
The following machine learning models are currently under development:
 
- Bayesian neural network
- Recurrent neural network

At the moment the following MPC and optimal control problems can be solved:

- Reference tracking nonlinear MPC
- Trajectory tracking nonlinear MPC
- Path following nonlinear MPC
- Economic nonlinear MPC
- Linear MPC
- Traditional optimal control problems

All the nonlinear MPCs support soft constraints, time-variant systems, time-varying parameters and can be used to solve 
minimum-time problems. They work for continuous-time and discrete-time models, in DAE or ODE form. Linear MPC is currently limited towards discrete-time models. 

A rich set of [examples](https://github.com/hilo-mpc/examples) is available, spanning:
- NMPC for bioreactors using hybrid first principle and learned models
- Trajectory tracking and path following model predictive control with learning and obstacle avoidance
- Output feedback MPC of a continuous stirred tank reactor with a Gaussian process prediction model
- Learning NMPC control using a neural network
- Simple LQR, PID 
- Moving horizon estimation, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and particle filter for a continuous stirred tank reactor

Installation
------------
Using Poetry (recommended):

```powershell
poetry install
```

Optional extras:

- Plotting backends: `poetry install -E viz`
- Data utilities: `poetry install -E ml`

From PyPI using pip:

```powershell
pip install hilo-mpc
```

Python support: 3.10–3.12 (aligned to current CasADi wheels). Newer versions may work once CasADi adds support.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------
HILO-MPC uses a minimal core installation by default. Additional features require optional dependencies, which are kept optional to avoid forcing users to install heavy packages they may not need.

### Installation with Extras

Install specific feature sets using Poetry extras:

```powershell
# Machine learning utilities (scikit-learn)
poetry install -E ml

# Plotting backends (Bokeh, Matplotlib)
poetry install -E viz

# TensorFlow backend for neural networks
poetry install -E tensorflow

# PyTorch backend for neural networks
poetry install -E pytorch

# Install multiple extras
poetry install -E ml -E viz -E tensorflow
```

Or with pip:

```powershell
pip install hilo-mpc[ml,viz,tensorflow]
```

### Optional Package Versions

| Extra | Packages | Version Constraints | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------------------|---------|
| `ml` | [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) | ≥0.19.2 | Data preprocessing and normalization |
| `viz` | [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org) | ≥2.3.0 | Interactive plotting |
| | [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) | ≥3.0.0 | Static plotting |
| `tensorflow` | [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) | ≥2.8.0 | Neural network training (TensorFlow backend) |
| | TensorBoard | ≥2.8.0 | Training visualization |
| `pytorch` | [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) | ≥1.2.0 | Neural network training (PyTorch backend) |
| | TorchVision | ≥0.4.0 | PyTorch utilities |

**Note:** The package will raise informative errors if you try to use features that require uninstalled optional dependencies. This design keeps the core installation lightweight while allowing users to install only what they need.

**Core Dependencies:** CasADi, NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and prettytable are installed automatically with the base package.
