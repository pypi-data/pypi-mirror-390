AILOOS - SOVEREIGN AI LICENSE RESTRICTIONS

In addition to the MIT License terms above, the following restrictions apply
specifically to the Ailoos library and its use:

1. SOVEREIGN AI PURPOSE: This software is designed exclusively for sovereign,
   decentralized AI training and inference. Any use that compromises user
   privacy, data sovereignty, or enables centralized AI control is prohibited.

2. FEDERATED LEARNING: The federated learning components must be used in
   accordance with privacy-preserving principles. Data must never leave the
   user's local environment without explicit, informed consent.

3. EMPOORIOLM MODELS: Any models trained using this library that incorporate
   EmpoorioLM or derivatives must maintain sovereignty and not be used for
   proprietary, centralized AI services.

4. NETWORK PARTICIPATION: When participating in the Ailoos network, users
   agree to contribute computational resources while maintaining full control
   over their local data and hardware.

5. COMMERCIAL USE: Commercial use is permitted under the MIT license, but
   must not violate the sovereign AI principles outlined above.

6. MODIFICATIONS: Any modifications to this library must maintain the
   security and privacy guarantees of the original implementation.
