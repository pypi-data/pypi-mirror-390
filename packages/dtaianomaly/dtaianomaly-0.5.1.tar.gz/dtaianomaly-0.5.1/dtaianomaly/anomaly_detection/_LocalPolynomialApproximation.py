class LocalPolynomialApproximation(BaseDetector):
    """
    Perform anomaly detection based on local polynomial approximations :cite:`li2007unifying`.

    The local polynomial approximation learns a forward estimate :math:`\\hat{x}_t^{(f)} = f(x_{t-1})`
    and a backward estimate :math:`\\hat{x}_t^{(b)} = b(x_{t+1})` for each observation in the time series.
    Both :math:`f` and :math:`b` are polynomials of a specified degree, and are estimated using a neighborhood
    before and after :math:`x_t`, respectively. The error of both estimators is computed, and the maximum
    error is taken as anomaly score, under the assumption anomalies have both a large forward and
    backward error.

    Parameters
    ----------
    neighborhood : int
        The size of the neighborhood for estimating the polynomials.
        The window size, the length of the subsequences that will be detected as anomalies. This
        value will be passed to :py:meth:`~dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection.compute_window_size`.
    power : int, default=1
        The power of the polynomial to fit. While any strictly positive value is valid, :cite:`li2007unifying`
        indicate that the local polynomial fit with odd order is better than that with an even order.
    normalize_variance : bool, default=false
        Wether to normalize the forward and backward estimates based on the variance of the forward
        and backward neighborhood, respectively.
    buffer : int, default=16
        A buffer at the start and end of the time series, used to ensure that sufficient data is available
        for fitting each polynomial. The buffer must be at least 3 to ensure that there is at least a single
        data point at the beginning and ending of the time series.

    Notes
    -----
    - LocalPolynomialApproximation only handles univariate time series.
    - The original version of :cite:t:`li2007unifying` normalizes the forward and backward scores. Their
      approach requires two additional parameters. Therefore, we did not implement this and leave normalizatin
      of the (aggregate) scores to post-processing.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from dtaianomaly.anomaly_detection import LocalPolynomialApproximation
    >>> from dtaianomaly.data import demonstration_time_series
    >>> x, y = demonstration_time_series()
    >>> poly = LocalPolynomialApproximation(neighborhood=50).fit(x)
    >>> poly.decision_function(x)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
