class MinMaxScaler(Preprocessor):
    """
    Apply min-max scaling on a given time series.

    Rescale raw time series to a [0, 1] via min-max scaling. The
    minimum and maximum is computed on a training set, after which
    these values can be used to transform a new time series. Therefore,
    there is no guarantee that the values of the transformed test set
    will actually be in the range [0, 1]. For multivariate time series,
    each attribute will be normalized independently, i.e., the minimum
    and maximum of each attribute in the transformed time series will
    0 and 1, respectively. If the minimum and maximum of an attribute
    is the same (the time series consists of only one value), then
    the transformation will not do anything.

    Attributes
    ----------
    min_ : array-like of shape (n_attributes)
        The minimum value in each attribute of the training data.
    max_ : array-like of shape (n_attributes)
        The maximum value in each attribute of the training data.

    Raises
    ------
    NotFittedError
        If the `transform` method is called before fitting this MinMaxScaler.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from dtaianomaly.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
    >>> from dtaianomaly.data import demonstration_time_series
    >>> X, y = demonstration_time_series()
    >>> preprocessor = MinMaxScaler()
    >>> X_, y_ = preprocessor.fit_transform(X, y)
