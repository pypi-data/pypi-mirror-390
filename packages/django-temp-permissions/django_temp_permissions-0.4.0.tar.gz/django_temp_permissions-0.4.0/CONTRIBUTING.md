## Using the issue tracker

You can suggest features, enhancements, or report bugs on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/k-tech-italy/django-temp-permissions/issues).

You can also use the issue tracker to find an open issue for you to work on. Please mention in the issue that you are working on it.

## Changing the codebase

You should fork this project, make changes in your own fork, then submit a pull request.

To start working on this project:
* Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv)
* Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    # using HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/k-tech-italy/django-temp-permissions.git

    # using SSH
    git clone git@github.com:k-tech-italy/django-temp-permissions.git
    ```
* If you use [direnv](https://direnv.net/), copy the `.envrc.example` file as follows, otherwise skip this step:
    ```bash
    cp .envrc.example .envrc
    ```
* Create a virtual environment for the project using uv. Make sure you use the earliest supported Python version (Hint check on tox.ini):
    ```bash
    uv venv create --python 3.10

    # if you're not using direnv, you need to manually activate the virtual environment
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
* Install the project's dependencies:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

You **must** make sure that your changes are covered by unit and integration tests, and that it follows the project's stylistic guidelines. In the absence of the latter, you should mimic the style and patterns in the existing codebase.

### Running tests

You should ensure that all tests are passing. We use `pytest` to write and run tests.
```bash
pytest tests
```

You should also make sure that your changes work with all supported versions of Python and Django. For that, we are using `tox`:
```bash
tox
```

### Formatting and linting

This project uses `ruff` to format and lint code.

Run the lints using `tox`:
```bash
tox -e lint
```

Format the code using `ruff`:
```bash
ruff check flags --fix
ruff format
```
