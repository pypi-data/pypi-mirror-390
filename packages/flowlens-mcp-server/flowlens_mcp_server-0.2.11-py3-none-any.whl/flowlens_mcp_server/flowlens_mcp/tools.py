    """
        Save a screenshot at a specific timeline relative second for a specific flow. 
        Screenshots are a key tool to capture the visual state of the application at a specific moment in time.
        The screenshot is taken from the video recording of the flow. 

        BEST PRACTICE: Always analyze timeline events FIRST before taking screenshots.
        1. Use list_flow_timeline_events_within_range to identify key moments
        2. Look for specific event types: console warnings, errors, user interactions, network failures
        3. Take screenshots at the EXACT relative_time_ms (converted to seconds) of interesting events
        4. For example: if event shows "relative_time_ms:48940", use second=48 or 49
        NOTE: You can use arbitrary seconds If you don't have specific events to investigate 
        e.g. when have a flow related to UX so you can take screenshots at multiple intervals to have a visual understanding of the flow.

        WHY: Screenshots are most valuable when tied to specific events rather than arbitrary time intervals.
        This approach helps you understand the exact application state when issues occurred.


        Important Note: The screenshot bottom middle contains a recording UI showing elapsed time. 
        IGNORE that UI element as it is part of the recording state, not the application state.

        Args:

            second (int): The second to take the screenshot at. 
                            IMPORTANT: Use the relative_time_ms from timeline events, converted to seconds.
