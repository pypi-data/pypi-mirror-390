hey jolanta,

sorted the query consistency issue.. published v0.1.58.

**bugs fixed**:
- cityfibre variants counted as separate operators (main issue)
- nexfibre not excluded from altnet queries (your version had this too)
- no dynamic date checking (added get_dataset_status tool)

**results**:
```
wrong (chat):    1=9.6M, 2=1.6M, 3=3.1M, 4=881k+
better (yours):  1=13.3M, 2=1.9M, 3=180k, 4=17k (nexfibre bug)
correct (fixed): 1=13.0M, 2=1.2M, 3=100k, 4=8k
```

**install**:
```bash
pip install --upgrade point-topic-mcp==0.1.58
```

agent can now check latest snapshot dates dynamically with get_dataset_status() tool.
