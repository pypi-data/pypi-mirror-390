        "DELFIN – DFT-based automated prediction of preferred spin states and associated redox potentials pipeline\n\n"
        "Prerequisites:\n"
        "  • ORCA 6.1.0 installed and available in PATH (academic license required)\n"
        "  • Recommended for some workflows: XTB and CREST available in PATH\n"
        "  • Create and edit CONTROL.txt (or run `delfin --define`) before running calculations\n"
        "  • Input geometry should be in XYZ format (atom count + comment line + coordinates)\n"
        "  • Optional: insert a line containing only '$' to split QM/MM regions – DELFIN keeps the\n"
        "    resulting QM/XTB setup for all follow-up jobs automatically\n\n"
        "Default behavior:\n"
        "  • If no options are provided, DELFIN runs the calculation pipeline using CONTROL.txt\n"
        "    and the referenced input file.\n"
        "  • The global scheduler attaches `delfin_run.log` in the working directory and OCCUPIER\n"
        "    subprocesses emit their own `occupier.log` alongside the standard ORCA outputs.\n\n"
        "Notes on --define:\n"
        "  • If you pass an .xyz file to --define (e.g. --define=foo.xyz), DELFIN will convert it\n"
        "    to 'input.txt' by removing the first two lines and will set input_file=input.txt in CONTROL.txt.\n"
        "  • If you pass a non-.xyz name (e.g. --define=mycoords.txt), an empty file with that name\n"
        "    is created and referenced in CONTROL.txt.\n"
        "  • If you omit a value (just --define), 'input.txt' is created by default.\n\n"
        "Notes on --control:\n"
        "  • Use --control=/path/to/CONTROL.txt to run with a CONTROL file outside the current directory.\n"
        "  • If the referenced CONTROL file points to an .xyz geometry, DELFIN automatically converts it\n"
        "    to a matching .txt input before the run starts (atom count/comment lines are removed).\n"
        "  • This is particularly useful for staged HPC jobs or batch workflows.\n\n"
        "Parallel workflows:\n"
        "  • Set `parallel_workflows=yes` (default) to let oxidation/reduction steps share PAL dynamically.\n"
        "  • Set `parallel_workflows=no` to force sequential execution; the scheduler still enforces PAL\n"
        "    globally but runs one FoB/job at a time.\n\n"
        "Notes on cleanup:\n"
        "  • `--cleanup` removes intermediate files from the runtime directory and exits.\n"
        "  • `delfin cleanup --orca` additionally terminates hanging ORCA jobs and purges OCCUPIER folders.\n\n"
        "Notes on --no-cleanup:\n"
        "  • Skips removal of intermediate files at the end of a run (they reside in DELFIN_SCRATCH when set).\n"
        "  • Handy when debugging or inspecting intermediates after automated runs.\n\n"
    "Notes on --purge:\n"
    "  • Removes everything in the working directory except CONTROL.txt and the primary input file.\n"
    "  • Always asks for confirmation before deleting files.\n\n"
    "Notes on --recalc:\n"
    "  • Only (re)runs external jobs whose output (.out) files are missing or appear incomplete.\n"
    "  • Existing results are preserved; parsing/aggregation is redone from what is on disk.\n"
    "  • A job is considered complete if its .out contains typical ORCA end markers such as\n"
    "    'ORCA TERMINATED NORMALLY'.\n\n"
    "Notes on --imag:\n"
    "  • Only runs IMAG elimination on existing .out/.hess files (skips OCCUPIER/classic/manually workflows).\n"
    "  • Respects IMAG_scope setting in CONTROL.txt (initial or all).\n"
    "  • After IMAG elimination completes, automatically generates a report with updated potentials.\n"
    "  • Useful when you already have converged structures but need to eliminate imaginary frequencies.\n"
