# DELFIN

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17208145.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17208145)

**Automated DFT-based prediction of preferred spin states and associated redox potentials**

This repository contains DELFIN, a comprehensive workflow tool for automated quantum chemistry calculations using ORCA, xTB, and CREST. DELFIN automates the identification of preferred electron configurations, tracks orbital occupation changes during redox processes, and calculates redox potentials.

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
pip install delfin-complat
```

**Requirements:**
- **Python 3.10+**
- **ORCA 6.1.0** in your `PATH` ([free for academic use](https://orcaforum.kofo.mpg.de/app.php/portal))
- **Optional:** CREST, xTB (for extended workflows)

> **Prereqs**
>
> * ORCA **6.1.0** in your `PATH` (`orca` and `orca_pltvib`)
> * Optional: `crest` (for CREST workflow), **xTB** if used (`xtb` and `crest` in `PATH`)
> * Python **3.10+** required

---

## Install

**PyPI Package**: https://pypi.org/project/delfin-complat/

From the `delfin` folder (the one containing `pyproject.toml`):

recommended (isolated) install
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
regular install
```bash
pip install delfin-complat
```

All Python dependencies (for example `mendeleev` for covalent radii) are installed automatically. Using a virtual environment or tools such as `pipx` keeps the scientific software stack reproducible and avoids system-wide modifications.

This exposes the console command **`delfin`** and enables `python -m delfin`.

---

## Quick start

Create a working directory with at least these two files:

* `CONTROL.txt` — your control/config file
* `input.txt` — the starting geometry (XYZ body without the first two header lines)
* starting from a `XYZ` file is optional

Then run:

from the directory that contains CONTROL.txt and input.txt
```bash
delfin
```
alternatively
```bash
python -m delfin
```

**CLI shortcuts**

- `delfin --define[=input.xyz] [--overwrite]`
  creates/updates `CONTROL.txt` and optionally converts an XYZ into `input.txt`.
- `delfin --control /path/to/CONTROL.txt`
  runs the workflow from another directory while normalising all paths.
- `delfin --no-cleanup`
  keeps temporary files and scratch folders after the pipeline finishes.
- `delfin --cleanup`
  removes previously generated intermediates and exits immediately.
- `delfin cleanup [--dry-run] [--workspace PATH] [--scratch PATH]`
  offers finer control over workspace/scratch cleanup; combine with `--dry-run` to preview deletions.
- `delfin cleanup --orca`
  stops running ORCA jobs in the current workspace, purges OCCUPIER scratch folders, and cleans leftover temporary files.
- `delfin --purge`
  clears the working directory (keeps CONTROL.txt and the configured input file only) after confirmation.
- `delfin --recalc`
  re-parses existing results and only restarts missing or incomplete jobs.
- `delfin --report`
  re-calculates redox potentials from existing output files without launching new calculations.
- `delfin --imag`
  eliminates imaginary modes from existing ORCA results (`*.out`/`*.hess`) and regenerates the summary report.
- `delfin --version`
  prints the installed DELFIN version (`-V` shortcut).
- `delfin --help`
  prints the full list of CLI flags, including the new pipeline/resource switches.

Results and reports are written to the current working directory,
e.g. `DELFIN.txt`, `OCCUPIER.txt`, and per-step folders.

## Excited-State Dynamics (ESD) Module

> **Status:** The ESD module is under construction and not yet production-ready.

The optional ESD pipeline optimises S0/S1/T1/T2 states and launches intersystem
crossing (ISC) / internal conversion (IC) calculations inside a dedicated `ESD/`
folder. Enable it via `ESD_modul=yes` in `CONTROL.txt`. It runs after the normal
redox workflows when `method` is set, or on its own when `method` is left empty.

Minimal CONTROL settings:

```ini
ESD_modul=yes
states=S0,S1,T1,T2
ISCs=S1>T1,T1>S1
ICs=S1>S0
```

Geometries, GBW and Hessian files are staged under `ESD/` and reused automatically.
All states inherit the system charge and use multiplicity 1 (triplets employ UKS internally).

> Note: the %ESD `DELE` entry is currently omitted; ORCA falls back to its internal defaults.
> Temperature is still taken from `temperature` (defaults to 298.15 K).

Directory snapshot:

```
ESD/
  S0.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  S1.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  T1.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  T2.inp/.out/.xyz/.gbw/.hess
  S1_T1_ISC.inp/.out
  ...
```

## Typical workflow switches (in CONTROL.txt)

* `method = OCCUPIER | classic | manually` (leave empty for ESD-only runs)
* `calc_initial = yes | no`
* `oxidation_steps = 1,2,3` (string; steps to compute)
* `reduction_steps = 1,2,3` (string; steps to compute)
* `E_00 = yes | no`
* `absorption_spec = yes | no`
* `parallel_workflows = yes | no | auto` (parallelization)
* `pal_jobs = N` (number of parallel PAL processes; auto-detected from cluster if not set)
* `orca_parallel_strategy = auto | threads | serial` (ORCA parallelization mode)
  - `auto` (default): Use MPI + OpenMP; FoBs run in parallel
  - `threads`: Use only OpenMP (no MPI); FoBs still run in parallel, useful if MPI is unstable
  - `serial`: Force sequential execution; only 1 FoB at a time
* `XTB_OPT = yes | no`
* `XTB_GOAT = yes | no`
* `CREST = yes | no`
* `XTB_SOLVATOR = yes | no`
* `ESD_modul = yes | no`
  * `states = S0,S1,T1,T2` (comma-separated subset)
  * `ISCs = S1>T1,...` (optional)
  * `ICs = S1>S0,...` (optional)
* `IMAG = yes | no`
  - enable imaginary-frequency elimination for pipeline runs and unlock `delfin --imag`
* `IMAG_scope = initial | all`
  - `initial` (default): only the starting geometry runs the IMAG loop; `all` processes every redox step
* `allow_imaginary_freq = N`
  - number of imaginary modes tolerated before IMAG restarts the step (default: 0)
* `IMAG_displacement_scale = float`
  - optional scaling factor for the `orca_pltvib` displacement amplitude (default: 1.0)
* `IMAG_sp_energy_window = float`
  - minimum single-point energy improvement (Hartree) required to accept a displaced geometry (default: 1e-6)
* `IMAG_optimize_candidates = yes | no`
  - when `yes`, each displaced structure is geometry-optimised before evaluating the single-point energy (default: `no`)

## Cluster & Workflow Integration

* **Scratch directory:** set `DELFIN_SCRATCH=/path/to/scratch` before launching jobs. Temporary files, markers, and runtime artefacts are written there (directories are created automatically).
* **Schema validation:** `delfin` validates `CONTROL.txt` on load (missing required keys, wrong types, inconsistent sequences) and aborts with a clear error message if something is off.
* **Logging:** the CLI now writes a timestamped `delfin_run.log` in every working directory and OCCUPIER subprocesses produce an additional `occupier.log` inside their folders. Custom drivers can still call `delfin.common.logging.configure_logging(level, fmt, stream)` to adjust handlers or formats.
* **Programmatic API:** use `delfin.api.run(control_file="CONTROL.txt")` for notebooks, workflow engines, or SLURM batch scripts. Add `cleanup=False` to preserve intermediates (`--no-cleanup`). Additional CLI flags can be provided through the `extra_args` parameter.
* **Alternate CONTROL locations:** supply `--control path/to/CONTROL.txt` (or the `control_file` argument in `delfin.api.run`) to stage input files outside the working directory.
* **XYZ geometry support:** if `input_file` in CONTROL (or the CLI/API) points to an `.xyz`, DELFIN converts it automatically to a matching `.txt` (header dropped) before the run.
* **Cluster templates:** see `examples/` for submit scripts:
  - `slurm_submit_example.sh` (SLURM)
  - `pbs_submit_example.sh` (PBS/Torque)
  - `lsf_submit_example.sh` (LSF)
* **Auto-resource detection:** DELFIN automatically detects available CPUs and memory on SLURM/PBS/LSF clusters and configures PAL/maxcore accordingly if not explicitly set in CONTROL.txt.

### Global Resource Management

DELFIN uses a **global job manager singleton** to coordinate all computational workflows and ensure that CPU resources (PAL) are never over-allocated:

* **Single source of truth:** PAL is read once from `CONTROL.txt` at startup and managed centrally throughout execution
* **Automatic PAL splitting:** When oxidation and reduction workflows run in parallel, DELFIN automatically splits available cores between them (e.g., PAL=12 → 6 cores per workflow)
* **Thread-safe execution:** All parallel workflows coordinate through a shared resource pool, preventing race conditions
* **Subprocess coordination:** OCCUPIER subprocesses receive their allocated PAL via environment variables and respect global limits
* **Sequential mode:** When workflows run sequentially (`parallel_workflows=no`), each workflow uses the full PAL

This architecture ensures:
- No double allocation of cores when ox/red workflows run simultaneously
- Consistent resource limits across all ORCA jobs spawned by DELFIN
- Proper coordination between main process and OCCUPIER subprocesses
- Efficient utilization of cluster resources without exceeding allocation

## Troubleshooting

* **`CONTROL.txt` not found**
  DELFIN exits gracefully and tells you what to do. Create it via `delfin --define` (or copy your own).

* **Input file not found**
  DELFIN exits gracefully and explains how to create/convert it.
  If you have a full `.xyz`, run: `delfin --define=your.xyz` → creates `input.txt` (drops the first two header lines) and sets `input_file=input.txt` in CONTROL.

* **ORCA not found**
  Ensure `orca` is callable in your shell: `which orca` (Linux/macOS) or `where orca` (Windows).
  Add the ORCA bin directory to your `PATH`.

* **`ModuleNotFoundError` for internal modules**
  Reinstall the package after copying files:


* **CREST/xTB tools missing**
  Disable the corresponding flags in `CONTROL.txt` or install the tools and put them in `PATH`.

---

## Dev notes

* Update CLI entry point via `pyproject.toml`
  `"[project.scripts] delfin = \"delfin.cli:main\""`
* Build a wheel: `pip wheel .` (inside `delfin/`).
* Run tests/workflow locally using a fresh virtual environment to catch missing deps.
