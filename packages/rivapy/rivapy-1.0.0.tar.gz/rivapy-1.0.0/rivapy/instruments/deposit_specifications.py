        Accrual start is adjusted according to the provided business day convention. Payment
        occurs on the maturity date (plus any settlement/payment days). For overnight ("O/N")
        and tomorrow-next ("T/N") deposits the :pyarg:`spot_days` is set to 0 and 1,
        respectively.

        Args:
            obj_id (str): Identifier for the deposit (e.g. ISIN or internal id).
            issue_date (date | datetime, optional): Fixing date and start date (of accrual period) of the deposit
                is calculated based on the provided issue date given :pyarg:`spot_days` and :pyarg:`adjust_start_date`. Required
                if :pyarg:`maturity_date` is computed from :pyarg:`term`.
            maturity_date (date | datetime, optional): Maturity date. If ``None`` and
                :pyarg:`term` is provided, the maturity will be derived from
                :pyarg:`issue_date` and :pyarg:`term`. Corresponds to end date (of accrual period). If non business day, always adjusted according to
                :pyarg:`business_day_convention` while end date adjustment is controlled by :pyarg:`adjust_end_date`.
            currency (Currency | str, optional): Currency code or enum. Defaults to "EUR".
            notional (NotionalStructure | float, optional): Face value; maybe passed as float or notional structure, amount must be positive. Defaults to 100.0.
            rate (float, optional): Fixed deposit rate (coupon). Defaults to 0.0.
            term (Period | str, optional): Tenor of the deposit (e.g. "3M", "1Y", "O/N", "T/N").
            day_count_convention (DayCounterType | str, optional): Day count convention.
                Defaults to :pydata:`DayCounterType.ACT360`.
            business_day_convention (RollConvention | str, optional): Business day convention
                used for rolling dates. Defaults to :pydata:`RollConvention.MODIFIED_FOLLOWING`.
            roll_convention (RollRule | str, optional): Roll rule when building schedules.
                Defaults to :pydata:`RollRule.EOM`.
            spot_days (int, optional): Settlement lag in days. Defaults to 2; overridden to 0
                for O/N and 1 for T/N when :pyarg:`term` is set accordingly.
            calendar (HolidayBase | str, optional): Holiday calendar to use. Defaults to ECB.
            issuer (Issuer | str, optional): Issuer identifier.
            securitization_level (SecuritizationLevel | str, optional): Securitization level.
                Defaults to :pydata:`SecuritizationLevel.NONE`.
            payment_days (int, optional): Days after maturity when payment occurs. Defaults to 0.
            adjust_start_date (bool, optional): If True, roll :pyarg:`issue_date` forward to a
                business day when required, to ensure accrual starts on a business day. The adjusted date will be used for calculations. Defaults to True.
            adjust_end_date (bool, optional): If True, roll :pyarg:`maturity_date` forward to a
                business day when required, to ensure accrual ends on a business day. The adjusted date will be used for calculations. Defaults to False.
