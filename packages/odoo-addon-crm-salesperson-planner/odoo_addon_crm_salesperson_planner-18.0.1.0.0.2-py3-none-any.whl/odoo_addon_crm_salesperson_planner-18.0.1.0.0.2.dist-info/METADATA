This application allows you to track and schedule salespeople visits to
your customers, allowing you to determine which opportunities are going
to be dealt on each visit.

Visits create an all-day event in the calendar and they can be easily
rescheduled. Visits can be automatically created from a template, in
which it is possible to select the frequency of visits, as well as the
start and end dates. The last visit can also be calculated by selecting
the total number of repetitions.

This module creates a cron job that generates visits from templates, but
an option to create them manually is available from the template form
view when the template is validated.
