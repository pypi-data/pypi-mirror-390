maintenance:
  schedule:
    security_updates: "monthly"
    dependency_review: "quarterly"
    major_upgrades: "annually"

  procedures:
    validation: |
      1. Run: python scripts/validate_dependencies.py --verbose
      2. Check Python compatibility for target versions
      3. Review security scan results
      4. Test in isolated environment

    upgrade: |
      1. Check for updates: python scripts/update_dependency.py {package-name} --check-only
      2. Test update: python scripts/update_dependency.py {package-name} --verbose
      3. Review release notes and breaking changes
      4. Update this file with new version
      5. Update this file with new version information
      6. Test workflow in dry-run mode
      7. Commit changes with descriptive message

      Follow the upgrade helper commands above for detailed procedures.

    upgrade_helper: |
      Use the update helper script for semi-automated updates:

      # Check for updates
      python scripts/update_dependency.py {package-name} --check-only

      # Test update with all Python versions
      python scripts/update_dependency.py {package-name} --verbose

      # Test specific version
      python scripts/update_dependency.py {package-name} --test-version 2.0.0 --verbose

      # Dry run to see what would happen
      python scripts/update_dependency.py {package-name} --dry-run

  rollback: |
    If a dependency update causes issues:
    1. Revert to previous version in workflow files
    2. Document the issue in this file
    3. Create issue to track resolution
    4. Test rollback in dry-run mode

    Use the rollback steps above for detailed procedures.

  best_practices:
    - "Only install packages from PyPI"
    - "Verify package integrity with checksums"
    - "Run security scans before every release"
    - "Use HTTPS for all package downloads"
    - "Validate SSL certificates"
    - "Set reasonable network timeouts"
    - "Minimize number of dependencies"
    - "Review package maintainer reputation"

troubleshooting:
  common_issues:
    - issue: "Package not found on PyPI"
      causes:
        - "Incorrect package name (e.g., tomllib-w vs tomli-w)"
        - "Package removed from PyPI"
        - "Typo in package name"
      resolution:
        - "Verify package name on https://pypi.org/"
        - "Run validation script"
        - "Check for alternative packages"

    - issue: "Version compatibility problems"
      causes:
        - "Python version incompatibility"
        - "Conflicting dependency versions"
        - "Breaking changes in new version"
      resolution:
        - "Check package Python version requirements"
        - "Review package changelog"
        - "Pin to last known working version"
        - "Test in isolated environment"

    - issue: "Security vulnerabilities detected"
      causes:
        - "Outdated package versions"
        - "Known CVEs in dependencies"
        - "Insecure code patterns"
      resolution:
        - "Review vulnerability details"
        - "Update to patched version"
        - "Consider alternative packages"
        - "Document risk acceptance if needed"
