Fscan documentation
===================

Fscan is a package that allows creating high-resolution spectra, spectrograms,
persistency figure of merit, and coherence plots for gravitational wave
detector strain data and auxiliary channels. This enables characterization of
detector strain data for persistent narrowband artifacts and pathways for
mitigation efforts.
