SmolPyGUI is a little personal project that I decided I would upload to PyPI. 
Below are some examples of usage.

A Simple Hello World
```python
from SmolPyGUI import initialize, Button, MainLoop

initialize((500,500)) #makes a 500x500 window

Button(300,300,100,100,"#ff0000",lambda: print("Hello World!")) #makes a 100x100 red button at 300,300 that prints "hey"

MainLoop() #starts the program
```

Let's Print Something More Fun
```python
from SmolPyGUI import initialize, TextBox, MainLoop

initialize((500,500))

#a quick reminder that for TextBox and TextDisplay objects the width argument is in characters, not pixels. (ie. width 5 means it can fit 5 characters of it's size in it's width)
TextBox(0,0,500,32,onEnter=lambda x: print(x)) #TextBox().onEnter and TextBox().onInput are both given the current TextBox text value when called, so this will print the value in the TextBox when the return key is pressed

MainLoop()
```
