"""Utilities for converting between floats and fixed byte representations.

This is commonly used for custom hardware serialization when messages don't 
change frequently but size is of the essence.

The range of possible input values can be fully specified by including EITHER
a lower bound (low) and an upper bound (high) OR a single bound (low or high)
and a resolution. Allowing for both methods of specification accommodates
varying specifications provided by hardware manufacturers.
