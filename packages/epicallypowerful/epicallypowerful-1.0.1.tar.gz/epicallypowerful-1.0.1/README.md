# Epically Powerful 🦿🤖🦾🚶🏻‍♀️👨🏽‍💻

**An open-source infrastructure for wearable robotics**

Epically Powerful is an open-source robotics infrastructure that streamlines the core framework of robotic systems — handling communication, timing, actuator monitoring, visualization, and data logging — so researchers can focus on controllers, experiments, and science.

Built for modularity, it unifies power systems, single-board computers, actuators, and IMUs into a cohesive plug-and-play setup.  Designed for modularity and speeding up the custom build process, it offers:
* Python-based coding interfaces for easy integration with commercial QDD actuators and common IMU sensors
* Parts lists, compatibility guides, and tutorials for rapid hardware and software setup
* Example controllers and real-time visualization through PlotJuggler
* Extensive documentation on every step of the setup process

Epically Powerful lowers the barrier to building custom robotic systems without enforcing a pre-specified form factor, enabling researchers to go from raw hardware to modular, robust devices quickly and effectively.

### 🤨 Why use it?

Epically Powerful was built by robotics researchers to make wearable robotics development faster, cleaner, and more reproducible.

* **Hardware-agnostic:** Works with multiple actuator and sensor brands — you’re not locked into any vendor or form factor.
* **Reproducible:** Shared configuration files, open schematics, and detailed setup docs make it easy to rebuild across labs or replicate prior builds.
* **Lower barrier to entry:** Verified hardware compatibility, handling of low level and backend code operation, and Python-based interface lowers the barrier for roboticists at all stages.
* **Built for iteration:** Swap hardware and test new controllers with minimal reconfiguration.
* **Open and vetted:** Maintained by a research community actively extending its capabilities across new hardware platforms and verified by multiple research groups.

In short, Epically Powerful turns “getting your robot to run” from a multi-week endevour into a single-day setup.
