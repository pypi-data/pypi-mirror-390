              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# planqk-commons

Set of common utilities and classes to boost development of quantum computing applications using PLANQK.

## Overview

`planqk-commons` is a Python library that simplifies the development of quantum computing services on the PLANQK platform.
It provides a runtime system that automatically handles input/output processing, parameter binding, and OpenAPI specification generation from your Python functions.

### Key Features

- **Zero-Configuration Runtime**: Automatically discovers and executes your entrypoint functions
- **Automatic Parameter Binding**: Maps input files to function parameters using type hints
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of sensitive values with automatic environment variable injection
- **DataPool Integration**: Direct access to mounted data pools for large file processing
- **OpenAPI Generation**: Automatically generates API specifications from function signatures
- **Type Safety**: Full support for Pydantic models and Python type hints

## Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Service Function

The simplest way to use planqk-commons is to define a function with type hints:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class InputData(BaseModel):
    values: list[float]


def run(data: InputData) -> float:
    return sum(data.values)
```

The runtime will:

- Read input files from the configured directory
- Parse them according to your type hints
- Call your function with the correct parameters
- Write the result to the output directory

### 2. Working with Secrets

For sensitive values like API tokens, use the `SecretValue` type:

```python
from typing import Optional
from planqk.commons.secret import SecretValue


def run(api_token: SecretValue, data: InputData, optional_key: Optional[SecretValue] = None) -> dict:
    # Access the actual value (single-use only)
    token = api_token.unwrap()

    # IMPORTANT: unwrap() can only be called once
    # Second call will raise ValueError: "Secret is locked and cannot be unwrapped"

    # Secrets are automatically redacted in logs
    print(api_token)  # Output: [redacted]

    # Handle optional secrets
    if optional_key:
        key = optional_key.unwrap()

    return {"status": "processed"}
```

**Environment Variable Mapping:**

Secrets are automatically loaded from environment variables following these patterns:

- `api_token` → `SECRET_API_TOKEN`
- `ibmToken` → `SECRET_IBM_TOKEN` (camelCase → UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)
- `iqm_token` → `SECRET_IQM_TOKEN` (snake_case → UPPER_SNAKE_CASE)

**Required vs Optional Secrets:**

- **Required secrets** (e.g., `api_token: SecretValue`): Must have corresponding environment variable or runtime will fail
- **Optional secrets** (e.g., `api_token: Optional[SecretValue]`): Set to `None` if environment variable is missing

**Security Features:**

- **Single-use unwrapping**: Once `unwrap()` is called, the secret is locked to prevent accidental reuse
- **Automatic redaction**: String representation always shows `[redacted]` to prevent logging exposure
- **JSON serialization**: Secrets are serialized to `{"value": "..."}` format but remain usable after serialization

**Naming Guidelines:**

Use generic parameter names to avoid exposing sensitive integration details in OpenAPI specifications:

✅ **Good**: `api_key`, `auth_token`, `credentials`, `quantum_token`
❌ **Avoid**: `prod_ibm_quantum_api_key`, `aws_secret_key_region_us_east_1`

### 3. DataPool Integration

For processing large files from mounted data pools:

```python
from planqk.commons.datapool import DataPool


def run(data: InputData, training_data: DataPool) -> dict:
    # List available files
    files = training_data.list_files()

    # Open and read files
    with training_data.open("model.pkl", "rb") as f:
        model = pickle.load(f)

    return {"files_processed": len(files)}
```

DataPools are automatically mounted from `/var/runtime/datapool/{parameter_name}` when you declare a parameter with type `DataPool`.

### 4. Runtime Execution

Run your service using the main runtime:

```python
from planqk.commons.runtime.main import main

if __name__ == "__main__":
    exit(main())
```

Configure via environment variables:

- `ENTRYPOINT`: Function to execute (default: `user_code.src.program:run`)
- `INPUT_DIRECTORY`: Input files location (default: `/var/runtime/input`)
- `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`: Output files location (default: `/var/runtime/output`)

### 5. OpenAPI Specification Generation

Generate OpenAPI specs automatically from your function signatures:

```python
from planqk.commons.openapi.generator import generate_openapi

generate_openapi(
    entrypoint="my_module:my_function",
    title="My Quantum Service",
    version="1.0"
)
```

Or use the Docker command:

```bash
docker run -v "$(pwd)/user_code:/workspace" planqk-commons openapi
```

The generator will:

- Extract parameter schemas from type hints
- Handle Pydantic models, primitives, and complex types
- Generate request/response schemas
- Create a `$secrets` object for SecretValue parameters

**Secret Parameters in OpenAPI:**

`SecretValue` parameters are automatically exposed in a special `$secrets` object in the request body schema:

```yaml
requestBody:
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        properties:
          # Regular parameters
          data:
            type: object
          # Secret parameters in $secrets object
          $secrets:
            type: object
            description: Secret values to be injected as environment variables
            properties:
              api_token:
                type: string
                description: Secret value for parameter 'api_token'
            additionalProperties: false
        required: [data, $secrets]
```

The API gateway uses this schema to map the `$secrets` object properties to environment variables before executing your service.

### 6. Advanced Type Support

The parameter binding system supports rich type annotations:

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, List
from datetime import datetime
from uuid import UUID


def run(
        data: InputData,
        config: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
        timestamps: List[datetime] = [],
        job_id: UUID = None
) -> dict:
    # All parameters are automatically parsed and validated
    return {"processed": True}
```

Supported types:

- **Primitives**: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`
- **Collections**: `List[T]`, `Dict[K, V]`, `Set[T]`, `Tuple[T, ...]`
- **Optional**: `Optional[T]`, `Union[X, Y]`
- **Pydantic Models**: Full support for `BaseModel` with validation
- **Special Types**: `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `UUID`, `Decimal`, `Path`, `Enum`
- **Platform Types**: `DataPool`, `SecretValue`

### 7. Function Resolution

The entrypoint system uses string-based function references:

```python
from planqk.commons.entrypoint import run_entrypoint
from planqk.commons.reflection import resolve_signature, resolve_function

# Get function signature
signature = resolve_signature("my_module.submodule:my_function")

# Execute with parameters
result = run_entrypoint(
    "my_module.submodule:my_function",
    {"param1": value1, "param2": value2}
)
```

## Examples

### Complete Service Example

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from planqk.commons.secret import SecretValue
from planqk.commons.datapool import DataPool


class CircuitParams(BaseModel):
    num_qubits: int = Field(ge=1, le=100)
    depth: int = Field(ge=1)
    shots: int = Field(default=1024)


def run(
        circuit: CircuitParams,
        backend_token: SecretValue,
        training_data: Optional[DataPool] = None,
        api_key: Optional[SecretValue] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Execute quantum circuit with optional training data and API authentication.

    Input files:
    - circuit.json: Circuit parameters

    Environment variables (required):
    - SECRET_BACKEND_TOKEN: API token for quantum backend

    Environment variables (optional):
    - SECRET_API_KEY: Additional API key if needed

    Data pools (optional):
    - training_data: Mounted at /var/runtime/datapool/training_data
    """
    # Use the token securely (single-use unwrap)
    token = backend_token.unwrap()

    # Handle optional secret
    key = api_key.unwrap() if api_key else None

    # Process training data if available
    files_used = []
    if training_data:
        files_used = list(training_data.list_files().keys())

    # Execute circuit (implementation omitted)
    result = execute_circuit(circuit, token, api_key=key)

    return {
        "result": result,
        "training_files": files_used,
        "shots": circuit.shots,
        "authenticated": key is not None
    }
```

## Development

### Setup

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv lock
uv sync
```

Update dependencies and lock files:

```bash
uv sync -U
```

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

### Export dependencies to requirements files

> This is useful to keep the project independent of the `uv` tool.
> Developers can install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` and `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
> Further, they may use a different tool to manage virtual environments.

```bash
uv export --format requirements-txt --no-dev --no-emit-project > requirements.txt
uv export --format requirements-txt --only-dev --no-emit-project > requirements-dev.txt
```

### Docker

Build the image:

```bash
docker build -t planqk-commons .
```

Run interactive shell:

```bash
