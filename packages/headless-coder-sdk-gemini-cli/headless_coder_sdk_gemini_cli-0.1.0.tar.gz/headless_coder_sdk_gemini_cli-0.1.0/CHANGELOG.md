# Changelog

## 0.1.0 – First release

We’re delighted to debut `headless-coder-sdk-gemini-cli`, wrapping the Gemini CLI in the shared headless coder interface. This release lets Python users tap into Gemini’s tooling with the same prompts, streaming, and structured output flows as the TypeScript SDK.
