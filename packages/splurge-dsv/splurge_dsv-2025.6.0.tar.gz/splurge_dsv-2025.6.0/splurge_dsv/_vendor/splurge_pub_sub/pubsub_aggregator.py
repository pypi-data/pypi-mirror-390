"""PubSubAggregator class for managing multiple PubSub instances.

This module implements the PubSubAggregator class, which aggregates messages
from multiple PubSub instances and forwards them to a single unified subscriber
interface.

class PubSubAggregator:
    """Composite PubSub that aggregates messages from multiple PubSub instances.

    PubSubAggregator subscribes to multiple PubSub instances and forwards all
    messages from those instances to its own subscribers. This enables a
    single subscriber interface to receive events from multiple independent
    PubSub buses.

    Message Flow:
        Managed PubSub instances → PubSubAggregator → PubSubAggregator subscribers

    Lifecycle:
        - Managed PubSub instances are created and managed externally
        - PubSubAggregator subscribes to managed instances (one-way flow)
        - PubSubAggregator can optionally cascade shutdown/drain to managed instances

    Thread-Safety:
        All operations are thread-safe using locks for synchronization.

    Example:
        >>> from splurge_pub_sub import PubSub, PubSubAggregator
        >>> bus_b = PubSub()
        >>> bus_c = PubSub()
        >>> aggregator = PubSubAggregator(pubsubs=[bus_b, bus_c])
