"""Top-level package for Splurge DSV.

This package provides utilities for parsing, processing and manipulating
delimited string value (DSV) files. It exposes the high-level API objects
such as :class:`~splurge_dsv.dsv.Dsv` and :class:`~splurge_dsv.dsv.DsvConfig`,
convenience helpers, and the package's exception types.

# Ensure current working directory exists. Some test environments or earlier
# test cases may remove the process working directory which causes calls to
# os.getcwd() to raise FileNotFoundError later during test execution. Guard
# against that here by switching to this package directory when cwd is missing.
# Ensure the required external implementation is available on import so the
# rest of the package can rely on its APIs. Fail fast with a helpful message
# instructing the user to install the package if it's missing.
