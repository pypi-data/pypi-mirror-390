    # FYI: 1000 steps/ticks ~ 1min
    "alpha_short": 1 / (20 * 1000 / 60),  # (short=20 seconds) Smoothing factor for exponentially weighted moving average of short-term log-likelihood 
    "alpha_long": 1 / (20 * 1000),        # (long=20 minutes) Smoothing factor for exponentially weighted moving average of long-term log-likelihood
    "w_short": 0.5,                       # Weighting factor to blend short-term log-likelihood vs long-term log-likelihood
    "ewma_weight": 1.0,                   # Weighting factor to blend EWMA vs instantaneous likelihood for wealth redistribution
    # When submitted to the platform, the model will be in a warmup phase for at least long=20 minutes.
