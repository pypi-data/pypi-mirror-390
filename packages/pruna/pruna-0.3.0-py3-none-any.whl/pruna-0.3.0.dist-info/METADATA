           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## <img src="./docs/assets/images/pruna_cool.png" alt="Pruna Cool" width=20></img> Introduction

Pruna is a model optimization framework built for developers, enabling you to deliver faster, more efficient models with minimal overhead. It provides a comprehensive suite of compression algorithms including [caching](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#cachers), [quantization](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#quantizers), [pruning](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#pruners), [distillation](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#distillers) and [compilation](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/compression.html#compilers) techniques to make your models:

- **Faster**: Accelerate inference times through advanced optimization techniques
- **Smaller**: Reduce model size while maintaining quality
- **Cheaper**: Lower computational costs and resource requirements
- **Greener**: Decrease energy consumption and environmental impact

The toolkit is designed with simplicity in mind - requiring just a few lines of code to optimize your models. It supports various model types including LLMs, Diffusion and Flow Matching Models, Vision Transformers, Speech Recognition Models and more.

## <img src="./docs/assets/images/pruna_cool.png" alt="Pruna Cool" width=20></img> Installation

Pruna is currently available for installation on Linux, MacOS and Windows. However, some algorithms impose restrictions on the operating system and might not be available on all platforms.

Before installing, ensure you have:
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Optional: [CUDA toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/) for GPU support

#### Option 1: Install Pruna using pip

Pruna is available on PyPI, so you can [install it using pip](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/setup/install.html):

```bash
pip install pruna
```

#### Option 2: Install Pruna from source

You can also install Pruna directly from source by cloning the repository and installing the package in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrunaAI/pruna.git
cd pruna
pip install -e .
```

## <img src="./docs/assets/images/pruna_cool.png" alt="Pruna Cool" width=20></img> Quick Start


Getting started with Pruna is easy-peasy pruna-squeezy!

First, load any pre-trained model. Here's an example using Stable Diffusion:

```python
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
base_model = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5")
```

Then, use Pruna's `smash` function to optimize your model. Pruna provides a variety of different optimization algorithms, allowing you to combine different algorithms to get the best possible results. You can customize the optimization process using `SmashConfig`:

```python
from pruna import smash, SmashConfig

# Create and smash your model
smash_config = SmashConfig(["deepcache", "stable_fast"])
smashed_model = smash(model=base_model, smash_config=smash_config)
```

Your model is now optimized and you can use it as you would use the original model:

```python
smashed_model("An image of a cute prune.").images[0]
```

<br>

You can then use our evaluation interface to measure the performance of your model:

```python
from pruna.evaluation.task import Task
from pruna.evaluation.evaluation_agent import EvaluationAgent
from pruna.data.pruna_datamodule import PrunaDataModule

datamodule = PrunaDataModule.from_string("LAION256")
datamodule.limit_datasets(10)
task = Task("image_generation_quality", datamodule=datamodule)
eval_agent = EvaluationAgent(task)
eval_agent.evaluate(smashed_model)
```

This was the minimal example, but you are looking for the maximal example? You can check out our [documentation][documentation] for an overview of all supported [algorithms][docs-algorithms] as well as our tutorials for more use-cases and examples.

## <img src="./docs/assets/images/pruna_cool.png" alt="Pruna Cool" width=20></img> Algorithm Overview

Since Pruna offers a broad range of optimization algorithms, the following table provides a high-level overview of all methods available in Pruna. For a detailed description of each algorithm, have a look at our [documentation](https://docs.pruna.ai/en/stable/).

| Technique    | Description                                                                                   | Speed | Memory | Quality |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| `batcher`    | Groups multiple inputs together to be processed simultaneously, improving computational efficiency and reducing processing time. | ✅    | ❌     | ➖      |
| `cacher`     | Stores intermediate results of computations to speed up subsequent operations.               | ✅    | ➖     | ➖      |
| `compiler`   | Optimises the model with instructions for specific hardware.                                 | ✅    | ➖     | ➖      |
| `quantizer`  | Reduces the precision of weights and activations, lowering memory requirements.              | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `pruner`     | Removes less important or redundant connections and neurons, resulting in a sparser, more efficient network. | ✅    | ✅     | ❌      |
| `factorizer` | Factorization batches several small matrix multiplications into one large fused operation. | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ |
| `kernel`   | Kernels are specialized GPU routines that speed up parts of the computation.  | ✅ | ➖ | ➖ |

✅ (improves), ➖ (approx. the same), ❌ (worsens)
