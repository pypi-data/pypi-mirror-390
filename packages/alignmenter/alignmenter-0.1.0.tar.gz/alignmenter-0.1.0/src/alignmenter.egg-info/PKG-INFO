              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Support. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

## Overview

**Alignmenter** is a lightweight, production-ready evaluation toolkit for auditing conversational AI systems across three core dimensions:

- **🎨 Authenticity**: Does the assistant stay on-brand?
- **🛡️ Safety**: Does it avoid harmful or policy-violating outputs?
- **⚖️ Stability**: Are responses consistent across sessions?

Unlike generic LLM evaluation frameworks, Alignmenter is purpose-built for **persona alignment**—ensuring your AI assistant speaks with your unique voice while staying safe and stable.

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alignmenter.git
cd alignmenter

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]

# Optional: Install with offline safety classifier
pip install -e .[dev,safety]
```

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install alignmenter
alignmenter init
alignmenter run --config configs/run.yaml --no-generate
```

> **Note**: The `safety` extra includes `transformers` for the offline safety classifier (ProtectAI/distilled-safety-roberta). Without it, Alignmenter falls back to a lightweight heuristic classifier. See [docs/offline_safety.md](https://github.com/justinGrosvenor/alignmenter/blob/main/docs/offline_safety.md) for details.

### Run Your First Evaluation

```bash
# Set API key (for embedding and judge models)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run evaluation on demo dataset (regenerates transcripts via the provider)
alignmenter run \
  --model openai:gpt-4o-mini \
  --dataset datasets/demo_conversations.jsonl \
  --persona configs/persona/default.yaml

# Reuse existing transcripts without hitting the provider
alignmenter run --config configs/run.yaml --no-generate

# View interactive HTML report
alignmenter report --last

# Sanitize a dataset in-place or to a new file
alignmenter dataset sanitize datasets/demo_conversations.jsonl --out datasets/demo_sanitized.jsonl
```

**Output:**
```
Loading dataset: 60 turns across 10 sessions
✓ Brand voice score: 0.82 (range: 0.78-0.86)
✓ Safety score: 0.97
✓ Consistency score: 0.94
Report written to: reports/demo/2025-11-03T00-14-01_alignmenter_run/index.html
```

## Features

### 🎯 Three-Dimensional Scoring

#### Authenticity
- **Embedding similarity**: Measures semantic alignment with persona examples
- **Trait model**: Logistic regression on linguistic features (trained via calibration)
- **Lexicon matching**: Enforces preferred/avoided vocabulary
- **Bootstrap CI**: Statistical confidence intervals for reliability

#### Safety
- **Keyword classifier**: Fast pattern matching for common violations
- **LLM judge**: GPT-4 as a safety oracle with budget controls
- **Offline classifier**: ProtectAI's distilled-safety-roberta (no API calls)
- **Fused scoring**: Weighted ensemble of rule-based + model-based signals
- **Adversarial testing**: Built-in safety traps in demo datasets

#### Stability
- **Cosine variance**: Detects semantic drift across conversation turns
- **Session clustering**: Identifies divergent response patterns
- **Temporal analysis**: Tracks consistency over time

### 📊 Rich Reporting

- **Interactive HTML**: Grade-based report cards with charts (Chart.js)
- **JSON export**: Machine-readable results for CI/CD pipelines
- **CSV downloads**: Per-metric exports for spreadsheet analysis
- **Turn-level explorer**: Drill down into individual responses

### 🔧 Production-Ready

- **Multi-provider support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, local (vLLM, Ollama)
- **Budget guardrails**: Halt runs at 90% of judge API budget
- **Cost projection**: Estimate expenses before execution
- **Reproducibility**: Logs Python version, model, seed, timestamps
- **PII sanitization**: Built-in scrubbing for production data

### 🚀 Developer Experience

- **CLI-first**: Simple commands for evaluation, calibration, reporting
- **YAML configuration**: Declarative persona packs and run configs
- **Python API**: Programmatic access for custom workflows
- **Comprehensive tests**: 69+ unit tests with pytest
- **Type safety**: Full type hints throughout

```bash
# Use Claude as safety judge, local embeddings
alignmenter run \
  --model openai:gpt-4o-mini \
  --judge anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 \
  --embedding sentence-transformer:all-MiniLM-L6-v2 \
  --dataset datasets/demo_conversations.jsonl \
  --persona configs/persona/default.yaml
```

### Bootstrap Synthetic Dataset

```bash
# Generate 50 conversations with adversarial traps
alignmenter bootstrap-dataset \
  --out datasets/my_test.jsonl \
  --sessions 50 \
  --safety-trap-ratio 0.15 \
  --brand-trap-ratio 0.20 \
  --seed 42
```

### Calibrate Persona Traits

```bash
# Train trait model from labeled data
alignmenter calibrate-persona \
  --persona-path configs/persona/mybot.yaml \
  --dataset annotations.jsonl \
  --out configs/persona/mybot.traits.json \
  --epochs 300
```

### Sanitize Production Data

```bash
# Remove PII before evaluation
alignmenter sanitize-dataset \
  --input prod_logs.jsonl \
  --out datasets/sanitized.jsonl \
  --hash-session-ids \
  --scrub-patterns "email|phone|ssn"
```

## Persona Configuration

Define your brand voice in YAML:

```yaml
# configs/persona/mybot.yaml
id: mybot
name: "MyBot Assistant"
description: "Professional, evidence-driven, technical"

voice:
  tone: ["professional", "precise", "measured"]
  formality: "business_casual"

  # Preferred vocabulary
  lexicon:
    preferred:
      - "baseline"
      - "signal"
      - "alignment"
      - "evidence-based"
    avoided:
      - "lol"
      - "bro"
      - "hype"
      - "vibes"

# Example on-brand responses (for embedding similarity)
examples:
  - "Our baseline analysis indicates a 15% improvement in alignment metrics."
  - "The signal-to-noise ratio suggests this approach is viable."
  - "Let's establish a clear baseline before proceeding."

# Trait model weights (generated by calibration)
traits:
  weights: [0.12, -0.34, 0.08, ...]  # Learned from annotations
  vocabulary: ["baseline", "signal", ...]
```

## API Usage

```python
from alignmenter.runner import Runner
from alignmenter.config import RunConfig

# Load configuration
config = RunConfig.from_yaml("configs/run/my_eval.yaml")

# Execute evaluation
runner = Runner(config)
results = runner.execute()

# Access scores
print(f"Authenticity: {results['scores']['authenticity']['mean']:.3f}")
print(f"Safety: {results['scores']['safety']['fused_judge']:.3f}")
print(f"Stability: {results['scores']['stability']['session_variance']:.3f}")

# Generate reports
from alignmenter.reporting import HTMLReporter, JSONReporter

html_reporter = HTMLReporter()
html_reporter.write(
    run_dir=results["run_dir"],
    summary=results["summary"],
    scores=results["scores"],
    sessions=results["sessions"],
)
```
