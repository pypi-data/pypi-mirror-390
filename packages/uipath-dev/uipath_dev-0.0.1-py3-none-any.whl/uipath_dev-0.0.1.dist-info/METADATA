# UiPath Developer Console

The **UiPath Developer Console** is an interactive terminal application for building, testing, and debugging UiPath Python runtimes, agents, and automation scripts.

## Overview

The Developer Console provides a local environment for developers who are building or experimenting with Python-based UiPath runtimes.
It integrates with the [`uipath-runtime`](https://pypi.org/project/uipath-runtime/) SDK to execute agents and visualize their behavior in real time using the [`textual`](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) framework.

This tool is designed for:
- Developers building **UiPath agents** or **custom runtime integrations**
- Python engineers testing **standalone automation scripts** before deployment
- Contributors exploring **runtime orchestration** and **execution traces**

## Features

- Run and inspect Python runtimes interactively
- View structured logs, output, and OpenTelemetry traces
- Export and review execution history

## Installation

```bash
uv add uipath-dev
```

## Development

Launch the Developer Console with mocked data:

```bash
uv run uipath-dev
```

To run tests:

```bash
pytest
```
