Interactive terminal application for building, testing, and debugging UiPath Python runtimes, agents, and automation scripts.

## Overview

The Developer Console provides a local environment for developers who are building or experimenting with Python-based UiPath runtimes.
It integrates with the [`uipath-runtime`](https://pypi.org/project/uipath-runtime/) SDK to execute agents and visualize their behavior in real time using the [`textual`](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) framework.

This tool is designed for:
- Developers building **UiPath agents** or **custom runtime integrations**
- Python engineers testing **standalone automation scripts** before deployment
- Contributors exploring **runtime orchestration** and **execution traces**
