A Python library inspired by [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) - automatically generates GraphQL APIs from your database schema.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is in early development. Currently supporting SQLite with plans to add support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and other databases in the future.

## ✨ Features

- 🗄️ **Database Introspection**: Automatically analyzes your database schema
- 🔄 **GraphQL API Generation**: Creates a GraphQL API based on your database structure
- 🎯 **SQLite Support**: Initial support for SQLite databases (more databases coming soon)
- 🐍 **Python Native**: Built for Python with modern best practices
- 📦 **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and configuration

## 🚀 Installation

### Using pip

```bash
