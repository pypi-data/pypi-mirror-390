           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  <strong>Agentscope ReMe: Memory Management Kit for Agents</strong><br>
  <em>Remember Me, Refine Me.</em>
</p>

---

ReMe provides AI agents with a unified memory system—enabling the ability to extract, reuse, and share memories across
users, tasks, and agents.

```
Personal Memory + Task Memory + Tool Memory = Agent Memory
```

Personal memory helps "**understand user preferences**", task memory helps agents "**perform better**", and tool memory enables "**smarter tool usage**".

---

## ✨ Architecture Design

<p align="center">
 <img src="docs/_static/figure/reme_structure.jpg" alt="ReMe Logo" width="100%">
</p>

ReMe integrates three complementary memory capabilities:

#### 🧠 **Task Memory/Experience**

Procedural knowledge reused across agents

- **Success Pattern Recognition**: Identify effective strategies and understand their underlying principles
- **Failure Analysis Learning**: Learn from mistakes and avoid repeating the same issues
- **Comparative Patterns**: Different sampling trajectories provide more valuable memories through comparison
- **Validation Patterns**: Confirm the effectiveness of extracted memories through validation modules

Learn more about how to use task memory from [task memory](docs/task_memory/task_memory.md)

#### 👤 **Personal Memory**

Contextualized memory for specific users

- **Individual Preferences**: User habits, preferences, and interaction styles
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Intelligent memory management based on time and context
- **Progressive Learning**: Gradually build deep understanding through long-term interaction
- **Time Awareness**: Time sensitivity in both retrieval and integration

Learn more about how to use personal memory from [personal memory](docs/personal_memory/personal_memory.md)

#### 🔧 **Tool Memory**

Data-driven tool selection and usage optimization

- **Historical Performance Tracking**: Success rates, execution times, and token costs from real usage
- **LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**: Qualitative insights on why tools succeed or fail
- **Parameter Optimization**: Learn optimal parameter configurations from successful calls
- **Dynamic Guidelines**: Transform static tool descriptions into living, learned manuals

## 📦 Ready-to-Use Memories

ReMe provides pre-built memories that agents can immediately use with verified best practices:

### Available Memories

- **`appworld.jsonl`**: Memory for Appworld agent interactions, covering complex task planning and execution
  patterns
- **`bfcl_v3.jsonl`**: Working memory for BFCL tool calls

### Quick Usage

```python
# Load pre-built memories
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/vector_store", json={
    "workspace_id": "appworld",
    "action": "load",
    "path": "./docs/library/"
})

# Query relevant memories
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8002/retrieve_task_memory", json={
    "workspace_id": "appworld",
    "query": "How to navigate to settings and update user profile?",
    "top_k": 1
})
```

## 🧪 Experiments

### 🌍 [Appworld Experiment](docs/cookbook/appworld/quickstart.md)

We tested ReMe on Appworld using qwen3-8b:

| Method       | pass@1            | pass@2            | pass@4            |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| without ReMe | 0.083             | 0.140             | 0.228             |
| with ReMe    | 0.109 **(+2.6%)** | 0.175 **(+3.5%)** | 0.281 **(+5.3%)** |

Pass@K measures the probability that at least one of the K generated samples successfully completes the task (
score=1).
The current experiment uses an internal AppWorld environment, which may have slight differences.

You can find more details on reproducing the experiment in [quickstart.md](docs/cookbook/appworld/quickstart.md).

### 🧊 [Frozenlake Experiment](docs/cookbook/frozenlake/quickstart.md)

|                                             without ReMe                                             |                                              with ReMe                                               |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <p align="center"><img src="docs/_static/figure/frozenlake_failure.gif" alt="GIF 1" width="30%"></p> | <p align="center"><img src="docs/_static/figure/frozenlake_success.gif" alt="GIF 2" width="30%"></p> |

We tested on 100 random frozenlake maps using qwen3-8b:

| Method       | pass rate        |
|--------------|------------------|
| without ReMe | 0.66             |
| with ReMe    | 0.72 **(+6.0%)** |

You can find more details on reproducing the experiment in [quickstart.md](docs/cookbook/frozenlake/quickstart.md).

### 🔧 [BFCL-V3 Experiment](docs/cookbook/bfcl/quickstart.md)

We tested ReMe on BFCL-V3 multi-turn-base (randomly split 50train/150val) using qwen3-8b:

| Method       | pass@1              | pass@2              | pass@4              |
|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| without ReMe | 0.2472              | 0.2733              | 0.2922              |
| with ReMe    | 0.3061 **(+5.89%)** | 0.3500 **(+7.67%)** | 0.3888 **(+9.66%)** |

### 🛠️ [Tool Memory Benchmark](docs/tool_memory/tool_bench.md)

We evaluated Tool Memory effectiveness using a controlled benchmark with three mock search tools using Qwen3-30B-Instruct:

| Scenario               | Avg Score | Improvement |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Train (No Memory)      | 0.650     | -           |
| Test (No Memory)       | 0.672     | Baseline    |
| **Test (With Memory)** | **0.772** | **+14.88%** |

**Key Findings:**
- Tool Memory enables data-driven tool selection based on historical performance
- Success rates improved by ~15% with learned parameter configurations

You can find more details in [tool_bench.md](docs/tool_memory/tool_bench.md) and the implementation at [run_reme_tool_bench.py](cookbook/tool_memory/run_reme_tool_bench.py).
