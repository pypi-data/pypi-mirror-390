Routines for removing background for beam analysis.

Full documentation is available at <https://laserbeamsize.readthedocs.io>

Two functions are used to find the mean and standard deviation of images.
`corner_background()` uses just the corner pixels and `iso_background()` uses
all un-illuminated pixels::

    >>> import imageio.v3 as iio
    >>> import laserbeamsize as lbs
    >>>
    >>> file = "https://github.com/scottprahl/laserbeamsize/raw/main/docs/t-hene.pgm"
    >>> image = iio.imread(file)
    >>>
    >>> mean, stdev = lbs.corner_background(image)
    >>> print("The corner pixels have an average         %.1f ± %.1f)" % (mean, stdev))
    >>> mean, stdev = lbs.iso_background(image)
    >>> print("The un-illuminated pixels have an average %.1f ± %.1f)" % (mean, stdev))

In addition to these functions, there are a variety of subtraction functions to
remove the background.  The most useful is `subtract_iso_background()` which will
return an image with the average of the un-illuminated pixels subtracted::

    >>> import imageio.v3 as iio
    >>> import laserbeamsize as lbs
    >>>
    >>> file = "https://github.com/scottprahl/laserbeamsize/raw/main/docs/t-hene.pgm"
    >>> image = iio.imread(file)
    >>>
    >>> clean_image = subtract_iso_background(image)
