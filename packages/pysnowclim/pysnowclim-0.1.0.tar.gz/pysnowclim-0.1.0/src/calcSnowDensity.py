    """
    Calculate new snow density following compaction as a function of SWE and snow temperature.
    Based on Essery et al. (2013), Anderson (1976), and Boone (2002).

    Parameters:
    -----------
    - lastswe: Snow water equivalent (SWE) in kg/m².
    - lastsnowtemp: Snow temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - packsnowdensity: Initial snowpack density in kg/m³.
    - sec_in_ts: Number of seconds in the current timestep.
