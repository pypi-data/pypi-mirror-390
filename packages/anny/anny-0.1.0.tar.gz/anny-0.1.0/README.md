### Features
- Anny is based on the tremendous work of the [MakeHuman](https://static.makehumancommunity.org/) community, which offers plenty of opportunities for extensions.
- We provide both full body and part-specific models for hands and faces.
- Anny is open-source and free.

## Installation

Full installation (uses warp-lang, which sometimes requires some manual work to install):
```bash
pip install anny[warp,examples]@git+https://github.com/naver/anny.git
```

Minimal dependency installation:
```bash
pip install anny@git+https://github.com/naver/anny.git
```

## Tutorials

To get started with Anny, you can have a look at the different notebooks in the `tutorials` repository:
- [Shape parameterization](https://naver.github.io/anny/build/shape_parameterization.html)
- [Pose parameterization](https://naver.github.io/anny/build/pose_parameterization.html)
- [Texture coordinates](https://naver.github.io/anny/build/texture.html)

## Interactive demo

We provide a simple Gradio demo enabling to interact with the model easily:
```bash
python -m anny.examples.interactive_demo
```
