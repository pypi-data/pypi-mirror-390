                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

The official Python SDK for the Repello Argus AI Guardrails API.

The Argus Python SDK provides a robust, high-performance interface for integrating Repello Argus into your Python applications. It allows developers to scan LLM prompts and responses in real-time to detect and mitigate a wide range of security, safety, and content risks.

This SDK is designed for both rapid prototyping with code-defined policies and enterprise-grade orchestration using the Argus Platform, enabling features like centralized policy management, detailed analytics, and conversation tracking.

---

## Key Features

-   **Comprehensive Security Policies:** Scan for PII, prompt injection, toxicity, secrets, banned topics, unsafe content, and more.
-   **Flexible Policy Management:** Define policies directly in your code for rapid development, or leverage the Argus Platform to manage policies centrally in the UI without code changes.
-   **Full Platform Observability:** Use Assets and Sessions to organize and track your data, providing deep insights into application usage and conversation context in the Argus dashboard.
-   **Developer-First Experience:** Built with type-safe enums (`Verdict`, `Action`, etc.) and a clear exception hierarchy for robust and predictable integration.
-   **Resilient & Performant:** Powered by `httpx` for modern, asynchronous-ready HTTP requests and `tenacity` for automatic, resilient retries on network failures.

## Installation

Install the package from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install repello-argus-client
```

The SDK requires Python 3.8 or higher.

## Quickstart

This example shows how to get started in under a minute. It defines a simple policy in code to block toxic prompts.

First, set your API key as an environment variable:
```bash
export ARGUS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Then, run the following Python code:
```python
# quickstart.py
import os
from repello_argus_client import ArgusClient, PolicyName, Action, Verdict

# 1. Load your API Key from the environment
API_KEY = os.environ.get("ARGUS_API_KEY")
if not API_KEY:
    raise ValueError("ARGUS_API_KEY environment variable not set.")

# 2. Define a simple policy in your code
my_policy = {
    PolicyName.TOXICITY: {"action": Action.BLOCK}
}

# 3. Create a client and perform a scan
argus_guard = None
try:
    argus_guard = ArgusClient.create(api_key=API_KEY, policy=my_policy)
    result = argus_guard.check_prompt("You are a piece of garbage.")

    # 4. Handle the result using the Verdict enum
    print(f"Verdict: {result['verdict']}")

    if result['verdict'] == Verdict.BLOCKED:
        print("✅ The prompt was blocked. Application should halt this request.")
    else:
        print("The prompt was allowed to proceed.")

finally:
    if argus_guard:
        argus_guard.close()
```

## Documentation

> For a comprehensive guide covering all features, advanced usage patterns, and a full API reference, please see our official documentation:
>
> **[https://docs.repello.ai/](https://docs.repello.ai/)**

## Usage Example: Platform Workflow

Platform users (with a Runtime Security Key) can leverage policies managed directly in the Argus UI. This simplifies the code significantly.

```python
# platform_usage.py
import os
from repello_argus_client import ArgusClient, Verdict

# This workflow assumes you have:
# 1. A Runtime Security Key (rsk_...).
# 2. An Asset created in the Argus UI with its own policy.
API_KEY = os.environ.get("ARGUS_RUNTIME_API_KEY")
ASSET_ID = "your_asset_id_from_the_dashboard"

argus_guard = None
try:
    # Connect to your asset and enable saving results to the platform.
    # Notice no local `policy` object is needed.
    argus_guard = ArgusClient.create(
        api_key=API_KEY,
        asset_id=ASSET_ID,
        save=True
    )

    # This scan will be evaluated against the policy configured in the Argus UI.
    result = argus_guard.check_prompt("This prompt will be checked against the UI policy.")

    print(f"Verdict from platform policy: {result['verdict']}")

finally:
    if argus_guard:
        argus_guard.close()
```
