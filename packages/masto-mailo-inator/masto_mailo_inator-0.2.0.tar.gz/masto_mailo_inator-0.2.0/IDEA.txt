File System Mastodon
===============================

The idea is simple: a fully file system based mastodon client.

1. User set their MASTODIR, like ~/masto
2. The script sets up:
  - a folder for each timeline (./home, ./favorites)
    - each of timeline folders follow maildir structure:
        - ./cur -> old messages
        - ./new -> new messages
  - an outbox (./OUTBOX)

When run, the client fetches new toots and puts them in ./new and creates new toots based on all files in ./OUTBOX.
Outbox is pruned automatically, new needs to be movied to cur manually.
