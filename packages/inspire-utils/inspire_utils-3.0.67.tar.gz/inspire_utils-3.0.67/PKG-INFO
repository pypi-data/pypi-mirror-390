Tests should be run both for python 2 and python 3.
For python 2 its recommended to run them through docker:
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.py2   -t inspire-utils:py2 .
docker run inspire-utils:py2 pytest tests
```

For python 3 you can run them locally:
```bash
pip install .[tests]
pytest tests
```
