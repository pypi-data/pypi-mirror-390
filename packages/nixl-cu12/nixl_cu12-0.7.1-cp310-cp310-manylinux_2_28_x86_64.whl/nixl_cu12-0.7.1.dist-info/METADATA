               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
         
               To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
               boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
               replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
               the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
               comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
               file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
               same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
               identification within third-party archives.

# NVIDIA Inference Xfer Library (NIXL)

NVIDIA Inference Xfer Library (NIXL) is targeted for accelerating point to point communications in AI inference frameworks such as NVIDIA Dynamo, while providing an abstraction over various types of memory (e.g., CPU and GPU) and storage (e.g., file, block and object store) through a modular plug-in architecture.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)
[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/ai-dynamo/nixl)](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl/releases/latest)

## Pre-build Distributions
### PyPI Wheel

The nixl python API and libraries, including UCX, are available directly through PyPI:

```
pip install nixl
```

## Prerequisites for source build
### Ubuntu:

`$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config`

### Fedora:

`$ sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake pkg-config`

### Python

`$ pip3 install meson ninja pybind11`

### UCX

NIXL was tested with UCX version 1.19.0.

[GDRCopy](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gdrcopy) is available on Github and is necessary for maximum performance, but UCX and NIXL will work without it.

```
$ wget https://github.com/openucx/ucx/releases/download/v1.19.0/ucx-1.19.0.tar.gz
$ tar xzf ucx-1.19.0.tar.gz
$ cd ucx-1.19.0
$ ./configure                          \
    --enable-shared                    \
    --disable-static                   \
    --disable-doxygen-doc              \
    --enable-optimizations             \
    --enable-cma                       \
    --enable-devel-headers             \
    --with-cuda=<cuda install>         \
    --with-verbs                       \
    --with-dm                          \
    --with-gdrcopy=<gdrcopy install>   \
    --enable-mt
$ make -j
$ make -j install-strip
$ ldconfig
```

### ETCD (Optional)
NIXL can use ETCD for metadata distribution and coordination between nodes in distributed environments. To use ETCD with NIXL:
#### ETCD Server and Client
 ```
$ sudo apt install etcd etcd-server etcd-client

# Or use Docker
$ docker run -d -p 2379:2379 quay.io/coreos/etcd:v3.5.1
```

#### ETCD CPP API
Installed from https://github.com/etcd-cpp-apiv3/etcd-cpp-apiv3

```
$ sudo apt install libgrpc-dev libgrpc++-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler-grpc
$ sudo apt install libcpprest-dev
$ git clone https://github.com/etcd-cpp-apiv3/etcd-cpp-apiv3.git
$ cd etcd-cpp-apiv3
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j$(nproc) && make install
```

### Additional plugins

Some plugins may have additional build requirements, see them here:

- [Mooncake](src/plugins/mooncake/README.md)
- [POSIX](src/plugins/posix/README.md)
- [GDS](src/plugins/cuda_gds/README.md)

## Getting started
### Build & install

```
$ meson setup <name_of_build_dir>
$ cd <name_of_build_dir>
$ ninja
$ ninja install
```

### Build Options

#### Release build

```bash
$ meson setup <name_of_build_dir> --buildtype=release
```

#### Debug build (default)

```bash
$ meson setup <name_of_build_dir>
```

#### NIXL-specific build options

```bash
# Example with custom options
$ meson setup <name_of_build_dir> \
    -Dbuild_docs=true \           # Build Doxygen documentation
    -Ducx_path=/path/to/ucx \     # Custom UCX installation path
    -Dinstall_headers=true \      # Install development headers
    -Ddisable_gds_backend=false   # Enable GDS backend
```

Common build options:
- `build_docs`: Build Doxygen documentation (default: false)
- `ucx_path`: Path to UCX installation (default: system path)
- `install_headers`: Install development headers (default: true)
- `disable_gds_backend`: Disable GDS backend (default: false)
- `cudapath_inc`, `cudapath_lib`: Custom CUDA paths
- `static_plugins`: Comma-separated list of plugins to build statically

### Building Documentation

If you have Doxygen installed, you can build the documentation:

```bash
# Configure with documentation enabled
$ meson setup <name_of_build_dir> -Dbuild_docs=true
$ cd <name_of_build_dir>
$ ninja

# Documentation will be generated in <name_of_build_dir>/html
# After installation (ninja install), documentation will be available in <prefix>/share/doc/nixl/
```

### Python Interface

NIXL provides Python bindings through pybind11. For detailed Python API documentation, see [docs/python_api.md](docs/python_api.md).

The preferred way to install the Python bindings is through pip:

```bash
pip install nixl
```

Or build from source:

```bash
# From the root nixl directory
pip install .
pip install <name_of_build_dir>/src/bindings/python/nixl-meta/nixl-*.whl
```

For Python examples, see [examples/python/](examples/python/).

### Rust Bindings
#### Build
- Use `-Drust=true` meson option to build rust bindings.
- Use `-Ddebug=false` for a release build.
- Or build manually:
    ```bash
    $ cargo build --release
    ```
#### Install
The bindings will be installed under `nixl-sys` in the configured installation prefix.
Can be done using ninja, from project build directory:
```bash
$ ninja install
```

#### Test
```
# Rust bindings tests
$ cargo test
```

Use in your project by adding to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
nixl-sys = { path = "path/to/nixl/bindings/rust" }
```

### Other build options
See [contrib/README.md](contrib/README.md) for more build options.

### Building Docker container
To build the docker container, first clone the current repository. Also make sure you are able to pull docker images to your machine before attempting to build the container.

Run the following from the root folder of the cloned NIXL repository:
```
$ ./contrib/build-container.sh
```

By default, the container is built with Ubuntu 24.04. To build a container for Ubuntu 22.04 use the --os option as follows:
```
$ ./contrib/build-container.sh --os ubuntu22
```

To see all the options supported by the container use:
```
$ ./contrib/build-container.sh -h
```

The container also includes a prebuilt python wheel in /workspace/dist if required for installing/distributing. Also, the wheel can be built with a separate script (see below).

### Building the python wheel
The contrib folder also includes a script to build the python wheel with the UCX dependencies. Note, that UCX and other NIXL dependencies are required to be installed.
```
$ ./contrib/build-wheel.sh
```

## Running with ETCD
NIXL can use ETCD for metadata exchange between distributed nodes. This is especially useful in containerized or cloud-native environments.

### Environment Setup
To use ETCD with NIXL, set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Set ETCD endpoints (required) - replace localhost with the hostname of the etcd server
export NIXL_ETCD_ENDPOINTS="http://localhost:2379"

# Set ETCD namespace (optional, defaults to /nixl/agents)
export NIXL_ETCD_NAMESPACE="/nixl/agents"
```

### Running the ETCD Example
NIXL includes an example demonstrating metadata exchange and data transfer using ETCD:

```bash
# Start an ETCD server if not already running
# For example:
# docker run -d -p 2379:2379 quay.io/coreos/etcd:v3.5.1

# Set the ETCD env variables as above

# Run the example. The two agents in the example will exchange metadata through ETCD
# and perform data transfers
./<nixl_build_path>/examples/nixl_etcd_example
```

### nixlbench Benchmark
For more comprehensive testing, the nixlbench benchmarking tool supports ETCD for worker coordination:

```bash
# Build nixlbench (see benchmark/nixlbench/README.md for details)
cd benchmark/nixlbench
meson setup build && cd build && ninja

# Run benchmark with ETCD
./nixlbench --etcd-endpoints http://localhost:2379 --backend UCX --initiator_seg_type VRAM
```
