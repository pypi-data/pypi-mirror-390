### Building from Source
To build IMDClient from source, we highly recommend using virtual environments.
If possible, we recommend that you use [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as your package manager through [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge). (You can substitute `conda` for `mamba` in the commands below if you prefer.)

Below we provide instructions both for `mamba` and for `pip`.

#### Source build with mamba
1. Ensure you have [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html) installed.

2. Create and activate a new environment:

```
mamba create --name imdclient
mamba activate imdclient
```

3. (Recommended) Install all dependencies using the provided environment YAML files for a clean and reproducible environment:

```
mamba env update --name imdclient --file devtools/conda-envs/test_env.yaml
mamba env update --name imdclient --file docs/requirements.yaml
```

4. Build and install IMDClient in editable mode:

```
pip install -e .
```

5. (Optional) Update dependencies:

```
mamba update --all
```

6. Deactivate the environment when finished:

```
mamba deactivate
```

#### Source build with pip

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install IMDClient from source:

```
pip install .
```

3. (Optional) For development (tests and docs):

```
pip install ".[test,doc]"
```
