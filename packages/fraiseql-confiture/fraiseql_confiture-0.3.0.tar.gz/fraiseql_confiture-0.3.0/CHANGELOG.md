## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- **Hexadecimal Sorting** - Support for hex-prefixed schema files (e.g., `0x01_`, `0x0A_`) for better organization of large schemas
- **Dynamic Discovery** - Enhanced SQL file discovery with include/exclude patterns, recursive directory control, and flexible project structures
- **Recursive Directory Support** - Automatic discovery of SQL files in nested directory hierarchies with deterministic ordering
- New configuration options for advanced file discovery (`include`, `exclude`, `recursive`, `order`, `auto_discover`)
- Build configuration section with `sort_mode` option for hex vs alphabetical sorting
- Comprehensive documentation for all new features with examples and migration guides
- 3 new test files covering hex sorting, dynamic discovery, and recursive directories

### Changed
- Enhanced `include_dirs` configuration to support object format with advanced options while maintaining backward compatibility
- Schema builder now supports multiple file naming conventions simultaneously
- File discovery logic refactored for flexibility and performance
- Updated documentation structure with dedicated features section

### Documentation
- Added 3 new feature documentation pages (hex sorting, dynamic discovery, recursive directories)
- Updated organizing-sql-files.md with hex sorting examples and patterns
- Enhanced configuration reference with new include_dirs options and build configuration
- Updated main documentation index to highlight new v0.3.0 features

### Performance
- Improved file discovery caching for better performance with complex directory structures
- Optimized recursive directory scanning algorithms

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-09

```bash
pip install --upgrade confiture
```

**What's New:**
- Rust extension auto-detected and used for performance
- Falls back to Python if Rust unavailable
- All existing code continues to work unchanged

**To verify Rust extension:**
```python
from confiture.core.builder import HAS_RUST
print(f"Rust available: {HAS_RUST}")
```
