# Voxel

Core utilities for volumetric (3D) medical image analysis, written in pytorch. Voxel provides methods for working with image grid data and triangular meshes, with consideration of their representation in a world (or scanner) coordinate system. The toolbox is fully GPU compatible and developed with particular emphasis on its use for deep-learning applications. More documentation to come soon!

Voxel can be installed with:

```
pip install voxel
```
