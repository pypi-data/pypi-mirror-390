VERIFICATION TASK: Review and verify the semantic versioning analysis.

You are a code review expert performing final verification of version bump decisions.

ORIGINAL ANALYSIS TO VERIFY:
{{ reasoning_output }}

COMMIT DATA FOR VERIFICATION:
{% for change in changes %}
--- COMMIT: {{ change.commit_hash[:8] }} ---
Message: {{ change.message }}
Files: {{ change.files_changed[:8] | join(', ') }}{% if change.files_changed | length > 8 %}...{% endif %}
Stats: +{{ change.insertions }} -{{ change.deletions }}
{% endfor %}

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. **Accuracy**: Does the analysis correctly identify the change types?
2. **Conservative Bias**: Is the version bump appropriately conservative?
3. **Consistency**: Are similar changes treated consistently?
4. **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases properly handled?

CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENT RULES:
- Lower confidence if analysis seems overreaching
- Raise confidence if analysis is clearly supported by evidence
- Consider project-specific patterns and conventions

**Your task**: Verify the analysis and provide your assessment in JSON format.
**Focus**: Be more conservative than the original analysis when in doubt.
