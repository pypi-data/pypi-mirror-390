## Basic Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant questions like:

- "Generate a health scorecard for computer with serial ABC123"
- "Find all computers that haven't checked in for 30 days"
- "What CVEs affect computers running macOS 14.5?"
- "List all configuration profiles and their scope"
